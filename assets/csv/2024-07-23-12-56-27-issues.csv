The `url` in the example is `https://checkout.kittens.mybigcommerce.com`, but if I send a request with my URL including the URL scheme I receive the error `Your checkout and storefront must be within the same main domain like 'main.com' and 'subdomain.main.com'`.

I removed the scheme from the `url` and the request succeeded.

Also I was originally sending the request with a scheme of `http`, because I used the example to [Create a Channel Site](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/channels/site#create-a-channel-site) first, but it seems `http` is ignored and `https` is always set - this is for good reason for sure, but it seems including the scheme in both examples is unnecessary.

The examples should be updated to not include the scheme in the `url`.

<!-- Provide an entry for the release notes using simple, conversational language. Don't be too technical. Explain how the change will benefit the merchant and link to the feature.

Examples:
* The newly-released [X feature] is now available to use. Now, you’ll be able to [perform Y action].
* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* Re-ordered the attributes of callbacks in our documentation so they match the order of webhook payloads.

## What changed?
Made changes based on my testing.

Outstanding issues:
1. The `is_featured` query parameter does not work as documented. Entering ""1"" or ""true"" does not work.
2. What field does the query parameter `inventory_low` related to? Is this the same as `inventory_warning_level`.
3. What field does the query paramter `out_of_stock` related to?
4. The values for the `keyword_context` query parameter give the same result.
5. What are the accepted values for the `status` query parameter?

* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* Removed enum list from order `payment_method` parameter / attribute in POST and GET calls.

## Anything else?
<!-- Add related PRs, salient notes, additional ticket numbers, etc. -->
* Order `payment_method` parameter / attribute was inconsistent because:
* - Enum list was included everywhere but PUT request
* Order `payment_method` parameter / attribute was misleading because:
* - Enum list suggested you had limited allowed values, when the parameter is fully writable.

## What changed?
This PR changes the request body of PUT site's routes to an array of objects, as pointed out by the SELFDEV-626 submitter. 

> Furthermore, the code sample for ""Update a Site's Routes"" is incorrect. Since it's a bulk update for all possible Routes, it should be wrapped in an array:
> ```
> [{
> ""id"": 0,
> ""type"": ""product"",
> ""matching"": ""5"",
> ""route"": ""/my-amazing-product""
> }]
> ```
> Attempting to run the code sample presently documented will result in this error:
> 
> ```
> ""status"": 422,
> ""title"": ""The request payload has to be a JSON array for the endpoint""
> ```

* The bigcommerce/docs repo now contains the OAS for promotions, inventory, locations, and other newer API features!
* It's now easier than ever to contribute to the docs. The source file structure in the repo now matches the Dev Center URLs. Finding the doc you want to modify never had less friction :) 
* This only applies to the narrative docs. API reference source file restructure is in the works as soon as we can give enough notice for all you API client maintainers to reset your references.

This PR actually fixes a little more than what is reported in #274. During development I noticed another problem (see commit 32bfcbb) which I decided to fix immediately instead of opening another issue. Feel free to discard this commit when merging the PR if that `required: false` is not an error.

permission_set
namespace
key
value
description
resource_type
resource_id
id
date_created
date_modified
owner_client_id

An actual API call emits the data in this order:
""id""
""key""
""value""
""namespace""
""permission_set""
""resource_type""
""resource_id""
""description""
""date_created""
""date_modified""
""owner_client_id""

Instead, the **documentation should list the fields in the same order as the API output**.  In this case, the API output is in a more logical order and is far preferred to the ordering listed in the documentation.  If possible, the preferred ordering would be:

""id""
""namespace""
""key""
""value""
""resource_id""
""resource_type""
""description""
""permission_set""
""owner_client_id""
""date_created""
""date_modified""


In general, throughout the BC documentation and API, field names should be listed in a logical order or alphabetical order, and ordered consistently in the field list, example JSON, and actual API output.  It's a big project to go through all that, but would it would improve the documentation considerably IMHO.

Currently there is ambiguity around what it means to be a subscriber or not. When a shopper is created during checkout, regardless a subscriber will be created (however they may not be opted in, a record exists regardless).

Specifically:
operationId | schema file | duplicated parameters
--- | --- | ---
`getCustomerStoredInstruments` | [customers.v3.yml](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/blob/8739e57a8c940b868822203350eb53738dfa72ef/reference/customers.v3.yml#L1596) | `customerId`
`getOrderConsignments` | [orders.v2.oas2.yml](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/blob/8739e57a8c940b868822203350eb53738dfa72ef/reference/orders.v2.oas2.yml#L979) | `order_id`
`getThemeConfiguration` | [themes.v3.yml](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/blob/8739e57a8c940b868822203350eb53738dfa72ef/reference/themes.v3.yml#L488) | `page`, `limit`
`previewWidget` | [widgets.v3.yml](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/blob/8739e57a8c940b868822203350eb53738dfa72ef/reference/widgets.v3.yml#L149) | `uuid`

Also, these duplications appears in the docs at developer.bigcommerce.com, which may cause confusion. Example for the `getCustomerStoredInstruments` operation:
![Duplicated `customerId` parameter in the `getCustomerStoredInstruments` operation](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/assets/147587711/fbf83395-fc2f-42ef-ae94-601aacb72d8e)

The type of array must have items in it but it is missing, because of that,  when we are using the parser it is not getting the component values.

when I parse by swagger-parser in Java OpenAPI returns the component as null.

It must have all the $ref information. It seems, that the structure is not correct that's why OpenAPI is not able to load the components.

The same case is happening with most of the swagger files.

## What changed?
<!-- Provide a bulleted list in the present tense -->
* Replaced the incorrect ""usd"" `currency.code` in Carts API > changed to correct ""USD""

## Release notes draft
<!-- Provide an entry for the release notes using simple, conversational language. Don't be too technical. Explain how the change will benefit the merchant and link to the feature.

Examples:
* The newly-released [X feature] is now available to use. Now, you’ll be able to [perform Y action].
* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* Merchants will be able to use the sample code for Carts with 'custom item' without running into an error.

# [DEVDOCS-5864]
Jira: [ANA-4629](https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/browse/ANA-4629)


## What changed?
* Updating the AddUserToStore documentation to reflect the security patch that the IAM team tackled as part of ANA-4629. The vulnerability there was that it was possible for attackers to enumerate through user ID's and retrieve all the emails of users throughout the platform if they were successful in using an ID that belongs to someone. The IAM team recommends that we instead use email as the identifier for users as part of this specific mutation, however we are still allowing for a set of accounts that have existing Users API tokens to continue using the original API contract as before.

Jira: [ANA-4629](https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/browse/ANA-4629)


## What changed?
* Updating the AddUserToStore documentation to reflect the security patch that the IAM team tackled as part of ANA-4629. The vulnerability there was that it was possible for attackers to enumerate through user ID's and retrieve all the emails of users throughout the platform if they were successful in using an ID that belongs to someone. The IAM team recommends that we instead use email as the identifier for users as part of this specific mutation, however we are still allowing for a set of accounts that have existing Users API tokens to continue using the original API contract as before.

I wanted to bring to your attention an observation I made while working on the create variants API. Specifically, I noticed that when the cost_price field is sent as null via API, it defaults to 0. However, when I create a variant from the UI, the cost_price is set to null when fetching the product from the API.

I assume there might be an inconsistency in how the cost_price field is handled between the API and the UI as the API documentation says that the null values and number is accepted.

Could we please review this observation and let me know if it is the expected behavior?

Thank you.",https://api.github.com/repos/bigcommerce/docs/issues/196/reactions,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,https://api.github.com/repos/bigcommerce/docs/issues/196/timeline,,reopened,bc-traciporter,64287776,MDQ6VXNlcjY0Mjg3Nzc2,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64287776?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter,https://github.com/bc-traciporter,https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/followers,https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/repos,https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/bc-traciporter/received_events,User,false

As you can see, there is no order_product_id. This means for this API endpoint https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{sttore_id}/v2/orders/{orderr_id}/shipments, i can't create a shipment, because i simply don't have the order_product_id and i have no way to get it.

I'm wondering if this is because of the variant ID. I have a feeling, the variant and product id might have to be combined? I'm not sure what's the problem.
https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_id}/v2/orders/{order_id}/products/{product_id}
-> This also strangely gives an error once i plug in the product id

## What changed?
<!-- Provide a bulleted list in the present tense -->
* Add endpoints to the Storefront Customers API
* Include customers/{customerId}/metafields (GET/POST)
* Include customers/{customerId}/metafields/{metafieldId} (GET/PUT/DELETE)

## Release notes draft
<!-- Provide an entry for the release notes using simple, conversational language. Don't be too technical. Explain how the change will benefit the merchant and link to the feature.

Examples:
* The newly-released [X feature] is now available to use. Now, you’ll be able to [perform Y action].
* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* Now you can add metafields to Customers, as well as look up a Customer's metafield by metafieldId. This collection of APIs provide you with the actions needed to provide more Customer information (from a list), and the ability to delete what you don't want.

But `royalmail` is missing from [the YAML spec](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/blob/735852537eba7bc684bff9b56cdecfdd78739fdc/reference/orders.v2.oas2.yml#L3564C1-L3577C24) for `shipping_provider`

## Current issue:
`categories_catalog.v3.yml` does not pass Swagger validation

## What changed?
Remove invalid `title` schema field in `categories_catalog.v3.yml`

While working on an internal tool, I noticed that the swagger parser began failing after pulling the latest API schema due to this file.

## Release notes draft
 * Fixed `categories_catalog.v3.yml` to ensure it is a valid Swagger format

## Anything else?

## What changed?
<!-- Provide a bulleted list in the present tense -->
* For `GET` `/v3/catalog/products` endpoint, define `categories:in` query parameter schema as array of integers
* Schema currently defines an integer but it should be an array of integers.  For example, this is valid: `/v3/catalog/products?categories:in=24,25`
* See `id:in` schema: https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs/blob/47b47056ddb3274a7ab16c3db7b7c7749eacefd8/reference/catalog/products_catalog.v3.yml#L71-L78

## Release notes draft
<!-- Provide an entry for the release notes using simple, conversational language. Don't be too technical. Explain how the change will benefit the merchant and link to the feature.

Examples:
* The newly-released [X feature] is now available to use. Now, you’ll be able to [perform Y action].
* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* Allow multiple categories to be used with `categories:in` parameter on `/v3/catalog/products` endpoint.

# ISSUE-57
* #57


## What changed?
<!-- Provide a bulleted list in the present tense -->
* change id to category_id where appropriate

## Release notes draft
<!-- Provide an entry for the release notes using simple, conversational language. Don't be too technical. Explain how the change will benefit the merchant and link to the feature.

Examples:
* The newly-released [X feature] is now available to use. Now, you’ll be able to [perform Y action].
* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* We fixed a bug in the Category Trees spec that incorrectly described a category response object as containing `id`s, rather than `category_id`s. Thanks to @atensoftware for raising this in Issue 57!

# [DEVDOCS-4878]
* Original PR [bigcommerce/api-specs 1469](https://github.com/bigcommerce/api-specs/pull/1469) by @bobbyshaw.

> As per OpenAPI specification guidance for operationID field, follow programmatic conventions for operationId field. To me that means as if I were defining a method or function name.
> This field is not used in the API docs as far as I can tell. There were
many different naming conventions across APIs. I've aligned to be camel case.
> This helps facilitate API SDK generation as all endpoints can have a function name based on the operation ID and have it have sufficient context to be unique amongst all APIs.

## What changed?
* Make operation IDs consistent and follow programmatic conventions

## Release notes draft
<!-- Provide an entry for the release notes using simple, conversational language. Don't be too technical. Explain how the change will benefit the merchant and link to the feature.

Examples:
* The newly-released [X feature] is now available to use. Now, you’ll be able to [perform Y action].
* We're happy to announce [X feature], which can help you  [perform Y action].
* [X feature] helps you to create [Y response] using the [Z query parameter]. Now, you can deliver [ex, localized shopping experiences for your customers].
* Fixed a bug in the [X endpoint]. Now the [Y field] will appear when you click [Z option]. -->
* A valued partner has put in the heroic work to make the OAS operation IDs programmatic across our public APIs. The operationId property is now consistently camelCase and relates to the plain-language name of the endpoint. Thanks, @bobbyshaw!

The [stencil-cli install documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/stencil/cli/install) advises to use node version `20.10.0`, however, most @bigcommerce libraries do not support v20. Instead looking for node versions lower than 19 and higher than 16.

Using node v20 results in the following errors when using Cornerstone.

```
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: '@bigcommerce/stencil-cli@7.3.1',
npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '>=16.0.0 <19.0.0', npm: '>=8.0.0 <10.0.0' },
