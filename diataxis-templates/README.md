## Purpose

Diataxis is a framework that helps standardize the purpose and content of each page in our documentation.

We use diataxis to help outline the types of content that make up our API Documentation.

## Diataxis types

There are four main types of documentation:

- Overview: Introduces a topic to help users understand how a feature works at a high level.
- Tutorials: Helps learners develop basic skills and understanding, preparing them to explore the rest of the product.
- Guides: Outlines steps for completing a task in order. It helps users apply their existing skills to accomplish the task effectively.
- Reference: Describe a product's behavior and usage, organized for quick skimming and selective use.

There are many online sources that explain the difference between each Diataxis type in documentation.

## Diataxis templates

As a starting point, the following templates provide concrete examples of how you can document content for each Diataxis type.

Some content in the Diataxis templates were based on the sources listed under [Diataxis types](#diataxis-types).

Templates may vary depending on feature size.
