#  Reference

The structure for a reference depends on the reference type; there is no universal template. 

However, references contain common elements, including product descriptions.

This article explains common elements within references and provides templates for these elements.

## Descriptions 

To see the descriptions you need to provide, see `checklist.mdx`.

> Note: In a description, add links to articles for explanation and/or context. If there is no link to an existing API Doc, use a link to a KB article.
