# API Reference Components

This page provides a checklist for REST and GraphQL API references.

> Notes: 
> The checklists ask for descriptions. For information on how to write these, see `reference.mdx`.
> When providing example requests and responses, it is best practice to demonstrate _main_ use cases.

## REST API reference

For each API endpoint, include the following at a minimum:

- [ ] Description for the overall endpoint
- [ ] Authentication method (OAuth scopes, etc)
- [ ] Server URL
- [ ] Path 
- [ ] Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) + Overall description for each method
- [ ] Request and request body schema
- [ ] Request and request body examples. State the example's use case in the title.
- [ ] Type for each property (string, integer, etc)
- [ ] Description for each property
- [ ] Tag for each method, used to group methods together
- [ ] API Status Codes (code, message, meaning) 
- [ ] Subscription levels (Enterprise, Pro plans, etc)
- [ ] Rate limits for each subscription level

If applicable, include the following:

- [ ] Usage notes
- [ ] Path & query parameters
- [ ] Default & min/max values
- [ ] Required flags
- [ ] Enum values (+ descriptions)
- [ ] Format

> Note: OAS3.0 files don't support descriptions for enum values. Add descriptions for enum values inside the description for the field.

You may need to add additional information to resolve linting errors, for example, global tags and operation IDs.

Consult surrounding or other endpoint files for conventions.

## GraphQL APIs reference

Reference documentation for GraphQL APIs are introspected from the code base. 

This includes example requests and responses, which are autogenerated from code bases.

The introspected reference for a GraphQL API should contain the following:

- [ ] Queries (+ description)
- [ ] Mutations (+ description)
- [ ] Types, including their fields & arguments (+ descriptions)
- [ ] Request examples
- [ ] Response examples
