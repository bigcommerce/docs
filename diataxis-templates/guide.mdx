# How to (task here)

[Draft an intro here.]

The introduction consists of 2-3 sentences to orient the reader:
1. Provide brief context to explain why the user would want to accomplish the task in the guide. Note that smaller features may not have separate overview page. In this case, briefly describe the background, feature, and use cases.
2. State the task that the guide accomplishes. The task should be specific, not open-ended.
3. (If applicable) Add images, graphics, or diagrams describing the guide's tasks.

[Example 1: Developers can build apps that can be installed on BigCommerce stores. Single-click apps are the recommended app type. In this quick start, you will create a single-click app using Node.js (Building Apps Quick Start).]

[Example 2: Buy Online, Pick up in Store allows shoppers to purchase online and pick up in store. The solutions at BigCommerce are primarily API-driven. This guide walks you through the steps on how to create customized Buy Online, Pick up in Store solutions for merchants and shoppers (BOPIS End-to-End Guide).]

## Prerequisites

State what a user needs to do the guide, which may include:
- Environment to use
- Authentication (any tokens, OAuth scopes, etc)
- Any prior knowledge or skills required for completing the guide
- A starting point, what they should have configured

Example 1: To complete the guide, you will need the following:
- [BigCommerce sandbox store](https://start.bigcommerce.com/developer-sandbox/) (required to develop and test apps)
- [Developer Portal Account](https://login.bigcommerce.com/login) (required to register apps)
- Experience using npm
- The most recent LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and its highest corresponding npm version

Example 2: This guide assumes the merchant has the following configured:
- A functioning BigCommerce store.
- Store settings, including Catalog, Payments, Tax, and Order Fulfillment
- A storefront that uses a custom checkout, such as…
- A store-level API Account that contains the following OAuth Scopes…

## Steps

**(Option 1) Getting Started Guides**

List step by step actions you need to take. Do the following for each step, as needed:
1. State what, where, and/or how to perform the steps. 
2. Add links to more detailed explanation.
3. Include checks, especially for special cases. 
4. Provide guidance on how to deal with unexpected possibilities.
5. Best practices

Steps may depend on the specific scenario and what users have available. Steps can be adaptable for real-world scenarios. 

The following template has some examples. Fill in the rest of the template for your guide. Add example code, requests, and/or responses as needed.

**Step 1** 
1. Step: If you want x, do y. To achieve w, do z. If xyz happens, then...
2. Link(s): For more info, see the article... 
3. Checks: If you are using x, perform or check the following...  
4. Other possibilities: For version y, you may find... in which case, do z...
5. Best practices: It is best practice to... We recommend using...

**Step 2** 
1. Step: Navigate to the root directory of your project and install npm packages using `npm install`.
2. Link(s): For more info on Checkout, see Checkout Overview.
3. Checks: Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to confirm the dev server is running. You should see content from `build/`.
4. Other possibilities: When the shopper is signed in, use the `https://{{store-url}}/login/token/{{token}}` URL as the url option for embedCheckout. For unauthenticated shoppers, use the `embedded_checkout_url` as the url option instead.
5. Best practices: It is best practice to include a version number in the Script URL field.

**(Option 2) API Guides**

API guides typically show how to manage the store or storefront using example requests and responses. 

Provide an example request and response for each method that an endpoint uses. For example, if the endpoint has POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE methods, provide an example request and response for each. 

For each example request in an API Guide, perform the following:
1. State what the example request accomplishes and any caveats for the example.
2. Add a link to the API reference endpoint. 
3. Provide a code example for the request headers and body. Request headers show the HTTP method and URL. 
4. Provide a code example for the response body.

The following template has an example. Fill in the rest of the template with your example requests and responses.

**Example 1**
1. Description: View aggregate inventory information for a product, across all locations that stock it. Send a request to the Get inventory at locations endpoint. The following example filters by variant_id.
2. Link to API Reference endpoint: Get inventory at locations, https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/inventory/items#get-inventory-at-locations
3. Request:

  ```
  GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/inventory/items?variant_id=123
  X-Auth-Token: {{access_token}}
  Accept: application/json
  ```

4. Response:

  ```
  {
    "data": [
      {
        "identity": {
          "product_id": 123
        },
        "locations": [
          {

        ]
      }
    ],
