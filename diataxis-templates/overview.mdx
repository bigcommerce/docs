# Overview for (topic)

State purpose of the overview.

[Example 1: This overview explains the core features that power multi-storefront, multi-channel stores.]

[Example 2: This overview introduces BigCommerce's Orders V2 and Orders V3 REST API resources.]

## Introduction

1. Provide background

   State the problem or gap that the feature addresses. Provide context to orient the reader. When you describe the situation, consider who, what, where, when, and/or why.

   [Example: Some merchants want to sell their products in different places. They may want to maintain multiple website-based ecommerce storefronts, or sell products from their store's catalog on other channels, such as Amazon, eBay, and in-person POS (point-of-sale) systems.]

2. Introduce the feature

   Describe the feature and how it fills in the problem or gap stated previously. Explain why the feature is useful. Explain how the feature works at the high level.

   [Example: Multi-storefront capabilities extend the reach of BigCommerce stores. Merchants can maintain multiple websites, on which they can configure and customize the look, feel, pricing, and organization of the shopping experience to support multiple distinct brands or sales goals.]

3. State target audience(s)

   [Example: Merchants that support cross-border transactions may benefit from this feature.]


## Concepts & Terminology


List all concepts that a feature or API uses. Include basic terms, those that are part of ecommerce culture, and those you were not familiar with before joining BigCommerce. 

For each concept or term:
1. Define the term and provide explanation.
2. (If applicable) List the components of a term. Provide a definition for each component.
3. Connect concepts to the overall feature and/or use case. This creates connections for the reader. 

To ensure clarity, explain acronyms once and then use the acronym consistently throughout your document.

The following template has an example. Fill in the rest of the template for your guide.

**Term 1: Channel** 
1. Definition & Explanation: A channel is a place where a merchant's store sells products. Storefront websites, marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, point-of-sale systems, and marketing feeds are all sales channels. A custom channel may not fit into any one of these types...
2. (If applicable) Components: A channel is defined by a name, type, and platform. A type is... A platform is...
3. Context: Channels can help to organize a merchant's complex business by allowing them to sell to many customers in many places from a single catalog in one BigCommerce store.

**Term 2** 
1. Definition & explanation:
2. (If applicable) Components: 
3. Context: 

**Term 2** 
1. Definition & explanation:
2. (If applicable) Components: 
3. Context:                                              

**Term 2**

## Use Cases 

APIs and features are designed so that they can be used under specific situations. Describe the specific situations in which a reader would benefit from the feature.

1. List specific tasks that you can perform with the API

   [Example: Track inventory across multiple locations.]

2. State specific situations in which you should use this API (or endpoint) in favor of another.

   [Example 1: Use the Inventory API as the default method for updating inventory. Absolute adjustments are batched, making them more resource friendly than the Catalog API.]

   [Example 2: Use relative adjustments only when you do not know absolute quantities. For example, making order-related inventory changes through a third-party may require relative adjustments. Otherwise, use absolute adjustments for updating inventory.]

## Design Context

Provide context to explain why a product is a certain way.

1. Technical constraints: Discuss constraints that affected the product design.

   [Example: To prevent excessive loads, the API sets a complexity limit.]

2. API design: The design of an API reflects the use cases. Explaining the API design helps readers understand how to use the API in their situation.

   [Example use case: Tax providers may sometimes need multiple inputs that can vary between different types of product. For example, for products with alcohol, the alcohol percentage and the volume sold affect alcohol taxes.]

   [Example Explanation for the API Design: Using Tax Properties, merchants can provide both pieces of information to tax providers. After you create tax properties, the API allows you to attach multiple tax properties to a product. This design also allows you to have tax properties that vary between different products; you choose which properties to attach to a product.]

## Additional Information

Depending on the feature, you may need to include additional information.

1. Details: Elaborate on various aspects of the feature. Provide alternatives. Explain behaviors, or why something does what it does.

   [Example: When you configure multiple currencies, BigCommerce will convert the catalog default currency price of items into the selected non-default currency on the storefront. It does not change the default catalog pricing of products.]

   [Example: The reason for x is because historically, y was only available for...W is used in favor of z because...Some users prefer w because z. This can be a good approach, but...]

   [Example: An x in system y is analogous to a w in system z. Thus, an x interacts with a y as follows. However...]

2. Visuals: Diagrams that clarify. 

   [Example: Diagram for MSF explaining stores, channels, sites.]

3. Relationships: Connect concepts to other features, approaches, or APIs.

   [Example: V3 Improvements section comparing Catalog V2 and V3 APIs]

4. Usage notes: Add details about how to use a feature.

   [Example 1: Deleting a coupon using this endpoint will delete the coupon but not the attached promotion.]

   [Example 2: Once the order is paid, the cart is deleted.]

5. Implications: Explore effects or outcomes.

   [Example: The Inventory API is not channel aware; inventory is shared across channels. Automated or bulk operations you perform with the Inventory API, as well as changes in stock level from a storefront order, will affect inventory available on all storefronts.]

## Limitations, Supported & Unsupported features

Provide a list for each of the following, if applicable:

1.  Platform or performance limitations

   [Example 1: Do not perform bulk operations using the Inventory API in parallel with bulk operations that use the Catalog or Orders APIs. Doing so may cause unpredictable, incorrect calculation results, as the Catalog and Orders APIs may force inventory calculations.]

   [Example 2: Wait to send new requests until the current request returns a 200 success status code.]

2. Supported and unsupported features.

## FAQs

- Include 5-10 questions that are asked by readers or pull highlights from the documentation.
- Questions should belong to a larger narrative. Goal-oriented questions should be fleshed out in a tutorial or guide, not listed under a FAQ. Avoid random questions; incorporate random details into the documentation.
- Each answer should be 2-3 sentence summaries. Include a link to the documentation topic, if any.

The following template has an example. Fill in the rest of the template for your guide.

**1. Good example question: Can I skip creating the quote and go straight to processing a refund?**

[Example answer: It is possible to process a refund without creating a quote first. Quotes serve to make sure you are refunding to the correct payment provider in the correct amount.]

**2. Bad example question: How do I create XYZ for my server?**

[Example answer: The question should be fleshed out in a tutorial or guide, not included as a FAQ question.]
