# GraphQL Storefront API: Orders (beta)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    This feature is currently in beta and only available to participants. 
</Callout>

## Overview
BigCommerce's Storefront GraphQL API provides the same access to “order” objects as the REST Storefront API. Having access to orders data in the storefront graph makes it easier to manage and build solutions for customer-specific use cases as shoppers transition from guests to registered customers.
You can use Storefront GraphQL API to create an end-to-end shopper experience and now manage customer account use cases such as showcasing their order history and order details. 

Order queries can do the following:
- Query a specific order to power order details including (site->order)
    - Billing address and customer information
    - Status of order
    - Specific shipments for a given order (a.k.a consignments)
        - Shipment address / Pickup Address
        - Products per shipment
        - Product specifics such as brand, name, variant and order quantity, and pricing.
    - Specific discounts, coupons (if applicable)
    - Costs
        - Subtotal
        - Additional costs such as tax, gift wrapping, shipment (if applicable)
        - Total
    - Time order placed
    - Payment/Payments information (Coming soon)
    - Order specific messages (Coming soon)
- Query all orders for a specific customer (site->orders)
    - Everything you can query for a specific order AND…
    - Filter orders by order status
    - Filter orders by order date
    - Support for cursor pagination
    - Order specific messages (Coming soon)
