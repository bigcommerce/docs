<Callout type="info">
    This feature is currently in beta and only available to participants. 
</Callout>

## Overview

BigCommerce's GraphQL Storefront Orders API provides the same access to order objects as the REST Storefront API. This GraphQL API can handle customer solutions as shoppers evolve from guests, to registered customers. You can manage customer account details that can pull up order history and order deatils.

Developers can use frontend GraphQL to create an end-to-end shopper experience. Orders related mutations and queries can do the following:

## Site order

- Query a specific order to power order details including (site->order)
    - Billing address and the customer's information
    - Order status
    - Consignment orders
        - Ship or pickup consignments
        - Products per shipment
        - Product specifics such as brand, name, variant, quantity, and pricing
    - Specific discounts, and coupons when applied
    - Pricing
        - Get pricing details
            - Such as tax, gift wrapping, shipping, etc., when available
            - Total amount
            - Order purchase timestamp
