# Available APIs

## Storefront APIs

### REST

[Learn more about storefront APIs](/api-docs/storefront/overview).

### GraphQL

### Add to cart URLs

## Management APIs

### V2 REST API

Mananage store resources from server-side code.

Some **V2** resources are not yet exposed in the **V3 API**; however, for resources that are accessible via both APIs, the **V3 API** is recommended; it contains performance optimizations and [other improvements](#v3-rest-api).

### V3 REST API

Mananage store resources from server-side code.

Interactions with the **V3** API are very similar to that of the **V2** API; however, the **V3** API introduces a number of improvements:
* Most tasks can be performed with fewer API calls (for example, a product with variants and custom fields can be created in a single request)
* Each **V3** resource includes a `meta` object, simplifying pagination
* **V3** Brands, Categories, Products, and Product Variants expose a [metafields](/docs/rest-management/catalog/product-metafields#create-a-product-metafield) resource for use by developers to store custom data.
* **V3** API is optimized for performance (in general, data can be sent, received, and processed faster via **V3**, relative to **V2**).

[Learn more about the V3 API](/api-docs/getting-started/about-our-api).

## Provider APIs

Implement endpoints consumed by BigCommerce for custom integrations (ex: custom shipping carrier rates via `/rates`).
