## Request headers

| Header | Expected value or type | Description | Example |
|:-------|:---------------|:------------|:--------|
| `authToken` | String | B2B Edition auth token | - |
| `Accept` | MIME types | The MIME type format that indicates which response type the request expects. For more information, see [HTTP Docs: Accept Header (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept). | `application/json` |
| `Content-Type` | MIME types | The MIME type of the request body. The API uses this value to validate and parse the request. For more information, see [HTTP Docs: Content-Type Header (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type). | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | String | We ask that you specify a user agent to identify your integration or client. | `PostmanRuntime/7.32.3` |

## Pagination

Use the `limit` and `offset` query parameters together to paginate responses. 

The `limit` value determines the number of records to return per page. The `offset` value is the number of results to skip before returning the first result.

For example, passing the following query param string returns the 11th through 20th results: `offset=10&limit=10`.

## Why do some API endpoints reference BundleB2B?

BundleB2B was a purpose-built application that powered BigCommerce's original B2B Edition offering.

In 2021, BigCommerce acquired BundleB2B. Since that time, we've been integrating the BundleB2B API and features into our core product offerings. We continue to use the BundleB2B domain to prevent breaking changes for existing integrations. Our roadmap includes plans to use a new core BigCommerce domain to host our B2B Edition APIs. `{*Does this need updating?*}`
