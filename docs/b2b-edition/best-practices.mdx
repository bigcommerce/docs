# Best Practices

## Ensure your integration is up-to-date

The B2B Edition team is actively developing both REST Management V3 API endpoints and the GraphQL Storefront API. We also integrate core BigCommerce updates as soon as possible.

## API rate limits

### Concurrent API call rate limits

Certain API resources rate limit concurrent requests. This is to ensure the performance and reliability of the platform for all of our users. API calls are metered on a per-store, per-endpoint basis. 

<Callout type="info">
  Do not exceed 10,000 requests per hour. This limitation is subject to change.
</Callout>

B2B Edition API requests that invoke additional API calls to BigCommerce's APIs are also subject to BigCommerce rate limits.
