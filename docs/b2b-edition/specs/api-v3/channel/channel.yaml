  title: Channels
  description: |-
    Channels are the primary structure for separating storefront experience for customers on the frontend. The endpoints provided by the B2B Edition API allow polling, but not management, of channel data. For details on managing channels and updating their settings via API, see [Channels](/docs/rest-management/channels).

    The B2B Edition channels endpoints are intended for use only in Multi-Storefront environments, and using them in Single-Storefront environments will result in unexpected responses.
