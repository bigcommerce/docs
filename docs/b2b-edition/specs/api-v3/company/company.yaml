    ## Introduction
    
    A Company in B2B Edition is the business account for B2B clients, which connects buyers in the business within its instance of the Buyer Portal.

    BigCommerce customer groups determine the products and pricing that a Company’s buyers see. Assign Company accounts to these groups as needed. Multiple Companies may share the same customer group, or remain unassigned to access the default catalog and pricing. The `customerGroupId` field maps Companies to customer groups.

    **NOTE:** If your store uses legacy Dependent Companies behavior, each Company account has a one-to-one relationship with a BigCommerce customer group. Once created, you cannot reassign the Company to another customer group; you can only delete it. See [Companies and Customer Groups in B2B Edition (Help Center)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Companies-and-Customer-Groups) to learn more about how Independent and Dependent Company behaviors work.

    ### Company Status Codes
    The `companyStatus` object indicates the activity status of a particular Company account in the response body of the following endpoints:

    * Get All Companies (can also be used as a parameter in the query)
    * Get Company Details
    * Update a Company’s Status

    This is expressed as a `string` or `integer`, with numeric values that correspond to a possible status. See the table below for more information:

    | Value | Company Status | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | Pending | A buyer has applied for a Company account, but the application has not been processed. |
    | 1 | Approved | The Company account is active. |
    | 2 | Rejected | The application has been rejected and the Company account cannot be used. |
    | 3 | Inactive | The Company account does not have any buyers assigned to it. |

    ### Company Account Hierarchy
    Account Hierarchy functionality establishes parent-child relationships between multiple Company accounts belonging to a single client business. Buyers assigned to Companies on higher layers can access the Buyer Portal for their subsidiaries. This functionality allows you to support clients with complex businesses, such as chain stores, franchises, and global corporations.
    
    ![Graphic explainer for company account hierarchies](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/account-hierarchies-examples.png)

    **NOTE:** This functionality comes enabled by default on all new B2B Edition stores. It is also available upon request for existing stores using the Buyer Portal experience and Independent Companies behavior. You can request Account Hierarchy by contacting our support team.

    Account Hierarchy adds support for the following endpoints:

    * Get Company Subsidiaries — View all accounts in lower layers of Account Hierarchy compared to a particular Company account.
    * Delete Company Subsidiary — Removes the parent-child relationship between a specified subsidiary account and its parent Company.
    * Attach a Company as the Parent of a Current Company — Assigns one Company account to the hierarchy layer directly above another Company.
    * Get Company Hierarchy — View all accounts in the same hierarchical structure as a particular Company.

    You can create up to **5 layers** of hierarchy for a given organization, and each hierarchy can have a maximum of **500 Companies** assigned to it.

    ### Company Roles and Permissions
      Buyers in a Company account, or *Company users*, are assigned a role that determines what they can view and configure within the Buyer Portal. B2B Edition includes predefined Company user roles, but you can also create custom roles with a unique set of permissions.

    Additionally, you can use the Company Roles and Permissions API to create custom permissions for more complex role-based access control. Note that custom permissions are **not** configurable from the B2B Edition control panel.

    #### Permission Codes
    When creating or updating Company user roles, you must specify the permissions that are enabled for the role and their scopes. The `code` field accepts the following default permission code strings, but you can also add the `code` value for custom permissions.

        Creates a new Company account. This endpoint also creates a Company user account for the administrator of the business.

        If you have configured required information fields in your store’s Extra Fields settings for Company accounts or Company users, you must include the field’s name and value in the `extraFields` array of the request body. For more information on extra fields, see [B2B Edition Settings](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/B2B-Edition-Settings) in the Help Center.

        After you have created a new Company account, you can configure all of its features and settings by using the [Update a Company](#update-a-company) endpoint.

        ### Independent vs Dependent Companies Behavior

        When [Independent Company behavior](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Companies-and-Customer-Groups) is enabled on your store, the system will not automatically create a dedicated customer group for each new Company account. Instead, you can assign a customer group to a Company account as needed using the `customerGroupId` field. If the `customerGroupId` field is not included in the request body, the Company account will be assigned to your configured default customer group.

        If you have not configured a default customer group or set the value of `customerGroupId` to `0`, the Company account will not be associated with any customer group, and its users will use your storefront’s default catalog visibility and pricing.

        If your store is using legacy Dependent Company behavior, a new customer group will be automatically created and associated with each new Company account. In this case, you will not use the `customerGroupId` field.

        If you have configured required information fields in your store’s Extra Fields settings for Company accounts or Company users, you must include the field’s name and value in the `extraFields` array of the request body. For more information on extra fields, see [B2B Edition Settings](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/B2B-Edition-Settings) in the Help Center.

        ### Independent vs. Dependent Companies Behavior

        This endpoint applies the same rules to the `customerGroupId` field as [Create a Company](#create-a-company), based on the Company behavior used in your store. Additionally, the `priceListAssign` field is not compatible with Independent Companies behavior because a Company’s price list is configured from its assigned customer group.

        If your store is using Dependent Companies behavior, use the `priceListAssign` field to assign a price list to the Company account.

        ### Independent vs. Dependent Companies Behavior

        If your store is using Independent Companies behavior, deleting a Company account has no effect on its assigned customer group.

        With Dependent Companies behavior, Company accounts and BigCommerce customer groups have a one-to-one relationship. Deleting a Company will also delete the corresponding customer group.

        When adding predefined Company permissions to a user role, refer to [Permission Codes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/b2b-edition/apis/rest-management/company/#permission-codes) for their `name` and `code` values.

        Some permissions require prerequisites that must also be enabled in the role, and assigned to the same or higher permission level. See [B2B Edition Buyer Roles and Permissions](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Buyer-Roles-and-Permissions) in the Help Center to learn more.

        Assigns the Company account as the parent of a specific Company. Note that you **cannot** assign a Company as the parent of another Company which is already in a higher hierarchy level.

        For example, if you have a client with local, national, and regional branches, their Company Account Hierarchy might look like this:

        ```
        - Americas
         |- North America
         | |- Canada
         | |- United States
         |- South America
         | |- Brazil
        ```

        You cannot assign *United States* as a parent of *North America*, since the parent Company for *United States* is also a subsidiary of *North America*.
