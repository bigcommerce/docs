    The Orders Storefront REST and GraphQL APIs allow you to retrieve order details from Company accounts. By authenticating requests as a Company user, you can retrieve information on the orders visible in their Buyer Portal.

    In order to return order information, you must generate a storefront authToken for a buyer with the following [Company user permissions](/b2b-edition/apis/rest-management/company#company-roles-and-permissions):

    - **Get orders**
    - **Get order detail**

    The storefront experience of placing an order, for both B2B and B2C customers, relies on the BigCommerce checkout or use of the standard BigCommerce APIs. As a result, the B2B Orders API does not include endpoints for creating new orders or adding existing orders. Use the [BigCommerce Orders V2 API](/docs/rest-management/orders) to accomplish these tasks.

    When specifying an order as a parameter of an endpoint, provide the **BigCommerce order ID** as the unique identifier. The **B2B Edition Order ID**, presented as the `id` value of certain B2B Orders API responses, is not a supported identifier for the `bcOrderId` field.

    ## Legacy Extra Fields

    The [Get All Orders](#get-all-orders) and [Get Order Details](#get-order-details) endpoints include the following legacy Company extra fields used by older stores:

    - `extraInt1`
    - `extraInt2`
    - `extraInt3`
    - `extraInt4`
    - `extraInt5`
    - `extraStr1`
    - `extraStr2`
    - `extraStr3`
    - `extraStr4`
    - `extraStr5`
    - `extraText`

    These fields return `null` values in newer stores. We recommend using the [Get Company Extra Fields](/b2b-edition/apis/rest-storefront/company/companies#get-company-extra-fields) endpoint to retrieve Company extra field information.

        Retrieves information for all orders placed by the Company user.

        Filter the order list using parameters. Common use cases include:

        - Retrieving orders placed within a specific date range (using `beginDateAt` and `endDateAt`)
        - Retrieving orders with a specific Purchase Order (PO) number
        - Retrieving orders in a specific status

        Use [Get Order Details](#get-order-details) to retrieve more detailed information about a specific order, such as product attributes, shipping method, and granular pricing.

        Equivalent Storefront GraphQL API Query: `allOrders`. For more information, see the [GraphQL Playground](https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/graphql/playground).

        This occurs automatically; however, you can populate extra information on a B2B order by using a [webhook](/docs/integrations/webhooks) that first listens for BigCommerce order creation and then calls the Create an Order endpoint. The request must be made within 10 seconds of an order's creation for it to be successful.

            This error occurs if the `orderId` value does not correspond to an existing order that was placed by the Company user. It can also occur if the storefront authToken used to authenticate the request does not have the required permissions to create an order.
            
            The error code in the response body appears as `40013` instead of `400`. This is because it is a 400 response for the Orders resource, which has a numeric identifier of 13.

        Retrieves detailed information for a specific B2B order. This endpoint's response provides more granular information than the [Get All Orders](#get-all-orders) endpoint.

        If the queried order originated with a quote, the negotiated discount will either be represented as an order discount or reflected in the product prices, depending on the type of discount that was applied.

        The `price_tax` field in the `products` array contains the amount of tax based on the item's non-discounted price, while `total_tax` contains the final tax amount after factoring in any discounts.

        Retrieves information related to products that a Company user has purchased. The information returned by this endpoint is different from the detailed product information returned by [Get Order Details](#get-order-details). However, it does include unique information like how many times a product was ordered and when it was last ordered.

        The response includes all products purchased by the Company user, but you can filter for a subset of products by using parameters. Common use cases include:

        * Retrieving products purchased within a date range by using `beginDateAt` and `endDateAt`
        * Retrieving products ordered a specific number of times by using `minOrderedTimes` and `maxOrderedTimes`
        * Retrieving information on similarly-named products by entering a partial product name as a `q` value
        * Retrieving information on a specific product by using `productID`

        Equivalent Storefront GraphQL API Query: `orderedProducts`. For more information, see the [GraphQL Playground](https://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/graphql/playground).
