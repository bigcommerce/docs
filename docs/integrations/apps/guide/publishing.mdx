# Publishing an App

After completing development, verifying best practices, and checking approval requirements, you may submit your app for Marketplace approval in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/). This article takes you step-by-step through the submission form and provides descriptions for each field.

## Before you begin

Your listing on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) plays a major role in your app's success. A good listing accomplishes three goals:
* Shows users how your platform or solution differs from competitive offerings
* Includes keywords so prospective users can find your listing in searches
* Sets up clear and accurate user expectations as to your solution's features and functionality

Before you begin completing the app registration, we recommend prepping the following assets:
* Company logos
* Screenshots and video content
* Case studies

We also recommend giving special attention to the following search indexed fields:
* App name
* App summary
* App category

## Provide technical information

In the **App information** tab, provide the relevant technical information required for the app’s functionality. Specify callback URLs and multiple user support. This tab also provides the app’s API credentials.

## Submit your app for approval

Submit apps for [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps) approval by navigating to the Dev Portal's [Apps overview](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps), then finding the app you want approved and clicking the **Publish app…** option from the action menu to the right of its listing. 

![Menu - publish](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/app-api-account/next-devtools-publish.png "Publish an App")

Review the information in the **Confirm listing information** page.

![Confirm listing information](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/app-api-account/next-devtools-publish-confirm.png "Confirm listing information")

Before submitting your app for approval, it is imperative to adhere to the recommended best practices listed below to ensure the integrity of the app marketplace and keep clients safe. 

* Integrate with the [BigCommerce JS SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) for Java-based apps. The SDK effectively allows management of the user’s session, keeping it in sync with the control panel.
* At a minimum, design apps to be cookieless (to comply with Chrome and Safari privacy/ security policies) and instead use JWTs to pass information.
* Never pass sensitive data using query parameters.

After completing all information, then click **Submit app for Review** to pay the review and listing fee and submit the app. Test the app before submitting it to avoid paying additional review fees.

If you have any questions about your submission, email [AppStore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).

## FAQ

**Are all fields required?**

For Marketplace approval, you'll need to fill out all fields on your listing with applicable content and links. These will be reviewed as part of the Marketplace approval process. The **Case Studies** field and **Videos** fields are optional.


**Am I able to preview the changes to my listing before publishing them?**

Yes! With the updated fields in the Developer Portal, we're also adding the ability to
preview how these changes will appear on the BigCommerce Marketplace. You will see the option to preview on a new step after Review when editing your listing.

**Is there a draft status for these changes, or will saving make them live?**

Any changes you save will take effect immediately, so make sure you're ready to push them out to the Marketplace before saving.

**I've logged in to the Developer Portal, but I don't see my published listing. Where is it?**

You may have logged in with the wrong account. Each listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely assigned to another email address. If you're unable to track down the correct owner account for your solution, please reach out to [appstore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).

**I saved my changes, but my listing has not updated yet. What's the problem?**

The changes will be effective immediately in your control panel app card, but the updates
can take up to 24 hours to appear on the App Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to make edits as needed.
