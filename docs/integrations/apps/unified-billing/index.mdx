# Unified Billing Overview
**GraphQL Account API**

Unified Billing allows merchants to buy apps through the BigCommerce App Marketplace and have the charges included on their BigCommerce invoice. 

### Requirements and limitations

To implement Unified Billing, you need to use the GraphQL API, as well as a [partner portal account](https://partners.bigcommerce.com) for reconciling charges with your other systems.

In order to use Unified Billing, you must sign the Unified Billing addendum within your partner portal account.

For the full list of requirements and limitations, see our Help Center article [Unified Billing for Partners](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Unified-Billing-for-Partners).

### Gathering Information 

Collect the following values to use later.

| Value | Description | 
|:--------|:-----------|
| Authentication headers | To authenticate API requests, visit the [account center](https://accounts.bigcommerce.com/tokens) and generate a new account-level API account. [Note the X-Auth-Token property](/docs/start/authentication) because you must include it in the request headers. You can't reaccess the credentials from this page, so save them somewhere safe. Use the following list of [OAuth scopes](/docs/integrations/apps/unified-billing#oauth-scopes) to inform the scopes you select for the API account. Note that the account used to create your application must match the account used to create the token in order to correctly authenticate with Unified Billing. If you have multiple applications, make sure you are using the token from the account that the application belongs to. |
| Partner ID | To retrieve the partner ID, sign in to the [partner portal (Impartner)](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/) and go to your account profile. |
| Partner account UUID | To retrieve your partner account UUID, sign in to the [Developer portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and copy the Account UUID from the top nav bar. | 
| Application ID | Create your app in the staging [developer portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and record your application ID. Make sure to also input your partner information associated with the app, especially the partner ID from the [partner portal (Impartner)](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/). |
| Merchant account UUID | To retrieve the merchant account UUID, send a request to the [Get Store Information](/docs/rest-management/store-information#get-store-information) endpoint and record the merchant's account_uuid from the response. | 


### Test Unified Billing with your app:

If your app is already published to production (i.e. visibility status = Public):
* Connect your app to Unified Billing
* Test using $0 checkouts, so that you don’t get charged real money.
* After you create a checkout, you can test completing of the checkout by creating and logging into a sandbox store as the Store Owner, and completing the checkout as a merchant would do.

If your app is NOT yet published to production (i.e visibility status = Draft, Under Review):
* Build your app and review the App Marketplace Approval Requirements
* Connect your app to Unified Billing
* Checkouts are limited to $0, so that you don't get charged real money.
* After you create a checkout, you can test completing of the checkout by creating and logging into a sandbox store as the Store Owner, and completing the checkout as a merchant would do.
* Submit your app for review and approval!
