# Unified Billing Overview
**GraphQL Account API**

Unified Billing allows merchants to buy apps through the BigCommerce App Marketplace and have the charges included on their BigCommerce invoice. 

To implement Unified Billing, you need to use the GraphQL API, as well as a [partner portal account](https://partners.bigcommerce.com) for reconciling charges with your other systems.

| Authentication headers | To authenticate API requests, visit the [account center](https://accounts.bigcommerce.com/tokens) and generate a new account-level API account. Note the X-Auth-Client and X-Auth-Token properties because you must include them in the request headers. You can't reaccess the credentials from this page, so save them somewhere safe. Use the following list of [OAuth scopes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/integrations/apps/unified-billing#oauth-scopes) to inform the scopes you select for the API account. | 
| Partner ID | To retrieve the partner ID, sign in to the [staging partner portal (Impartner)](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/) and go to your account profile. |
| Partner account UUID | To retrieve your partner account UUID, sign in to the [developer portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and copy the Account UUID from the top nav bar. | 
| Application ID | Create your app in the staging [developer portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and record your application ID. Make sure to also input your partner information associated with the app, especially the partner ID from the [partner portal (Impartner)](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/). |
| Merchant account UUID | To retrieve the merchant account UUID, send a request to [Get Store Information](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/store-information#get-store-information) endpoint and record the merchant's account_uuid from the response. |
