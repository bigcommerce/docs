# Unified Billing Overview
**GraphQL Account API**

Unified Billing allows merchants to buy apps through the BigCommerce App Marketplace and have the charges included on their BigCommerce invoice. 

To implement Unified Billing, you need to use the GraphQL API, as well as a [partner portal account](https://partners.bigcommerce.com) for reconciling charges with your other systems.

### OAuth scopes

The following scopes are in beta and pertain directly to Unified Partner Billing. For a complete list of generally available account-level OAuth scopes, see the [Guide to API Accounts](/api-docs/getting-started/api-accounts#account-resource-scopes).
