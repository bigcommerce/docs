# Unified Billing Overview
**GraphQL Account API**

Unified Billing allows merchants to buy apps through the BigCommerce App Marketplace and have the charges included on their BigCommerce invoice. 

To implement Unified Billing, you need to use the GraphQL API, as well as a [partner portal account](https://partners.bigcommerce.com) for reconciling charges with your other systems.

| Authentication headers | To authenticate API requests, visit the [account center](https://accounts.bigcommerce.com/tokens) and generate a new account-level API account. [Note the X-Auth-Token property](/docs/start/authentication) because you must include it in the request headers. You can't reaccess the credentials from this page, so save them somewhere safe.

| Application ID | Create your app in the staging [developer portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and record your application ID. Make sure to also input your partner information associated with the app, especially the partner ID from the [partner portal (Impartner)](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/). |
| Merchant account UUID | To retrieve the merchant account UUID, send a request to the [Get Store Information](/docs/rest-management/store-information#get-store-information) endpoint and record the merchant's account_uuid from the response. |
