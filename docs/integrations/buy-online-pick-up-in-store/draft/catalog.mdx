# Breaking Changes to Catalog API

## Writing Inventory:
Using the existing Catalog APIs to add or update inventory will not be supported with MLI enabled. The new Inventory APIs can be utilized to manage inventory for a merchant's catalog.

## Reading Inventory:
You will still be able to read an inventory value for products using the v2/v3 endpoints. However the behavior will change slightly. The inventory retunred from the Catalog API will be the total inventory available to sell for the merchant. This provides limited backwards compatibility with any apps or integrations that facilitate selling a merchants products on external sales channels, such as Amazon.
