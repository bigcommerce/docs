## 5.0 Manage order as a merchant

When building a _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ solution, you can allow merchants to manage orders that have pickup consignments. They can view and update the pickup consignment for an order.

### 5.1 View the newly-created order’s pickup consignment

To view the pickup consignment for the newly-created order, send a request to the [Get consignments](/docs/rest-management/orders/order-consignments#get-consignments) endpoint.

  <Tab>

    ```http filename="Example request: Get consignments" showLineNumbers copy
    GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v2/orders/{{order_id}}/consignments
    X-Auth-Token: {{access_token}}
    Accept: application/json
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```json filename="Example response: Get consignments" showLineNumbers copy
    {
      "pickups": [
        {
          "id": 13,
          "pickup_method_id": 2,
          "pickup_method_display_name": "Pickup Method 2",
          "collection_instructions": "Pickup Method 2 instructions",
          "collection_time_description": "Pickup Method 2 time",
          "location": {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "location2",
            "code": "LOCATION-2",
            "address_line_1": "2802 Skyway Cir",
            "address_line_2": "",
            "city": "Austin",
            "state": "Texas",
            "postal_code": "78704",
            "country_alpha2": "US",
            "email": "location2@example.com",
            "phone": "410123002"
          },
          "line_items": [
            {
              "url": "https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v2/orders/126/products/22",
              "resource": "/orders/126/products/22"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The order's pickup consignment is 13.

### 5.2 View the newly-created order's products  

To view the products for a newly-created order, send a request to the [Get order products](/docs/rest-management/orders/order-products#list-order-products) endpoint. The response returns products that were assigned to a pickup consignment.

<Tabs items={['Request', 'Response']}>
  <Tab>

    ```http filename="Example request: Get order products" showLineNumbers copy
    GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v2/orders/{{order_id}}/products
    X-Auth-Token: {{access_token}}
    Accept: application/json
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```json filename="Example response: Get order products" showLineNumbers copy
    [
      {
        "id": 22,
        "order_id": 126,
        "product_id": 97,
        "variant_id": 69,
        "order_pickup_method_id": 13,
        …
      }
    ]
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `order_pickup_method_id` field is 13 (same value as the pickup consignment ID).

### 5.3 Update pickup consignment

If you need to update the original pickup consignment details, you have the ability to do so using the Orders API. You can update the:
* `pickup_method_id`
* `pickup_method_display_name`
* `collection_instructions`
* `collection_time_description`
* location attributes (except for the `location_id`)

To update a pickup consignment, send a request to the [Update an order](/docs/rest-management/orders#updates-an-order) endpoint.
