* A storefront that uses a [custom checkout](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/open-checkouts/guide), such as one of the following:   
  - a new or existing checkout built with the [Checkout JS SDK](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/checkout-sdk)
  - a headless storefront that uses the [Store Management Checkout API](/docs/rest-management/checkouts)
* A [store-level API account](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#store-api-accounts) that contains the following [OAuth scopes](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#oauth-scopes):

| UI Name | Permission | Parameter | Description |
