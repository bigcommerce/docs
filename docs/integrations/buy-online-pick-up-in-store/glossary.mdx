# Glossary


## BOPIS

An acronym, commonly used in North America, that stands for _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_. 


## Click & Collect

Another term for _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_.


## Consignment

_Consignment_ refers to a list of line items and information about how those items should be fulfilled, as captured during the checkout or order creation process. This includes the transit path they take to move from their stock location into the shopper’s possession.

In practice, a consignment is a collection of store catalog item identifiers and their quantities, along with fulfillment information. There are two main fulfillment types: _shipping_ and _pickup_. The consignment provides details required to complete the selected type of fulfillment, such as a pickup location ID, or a shipping destination address with a shipping origin location ID. 

A consignment captures the shopper’s wishes about how they’d like to receive their order. A consignment does not necessarily represent how the merchant actually chooses to fulfill the shopper’s order.

## Location

_Location_ is a concept that allows merchants to track product inventory across multiple physical or virtual locations. Locations also allow merchants to manage their store and warehouse physical addresses in a single source of truth, which can be used by tools such as store locator widgets or app integrations that are concerned with locations where a store’s business is conducted. 

## Pickup 

_Pickup_ is a concept analogous to _shipment_. It allows merchants to track and record order consignments that are fulfilled when someone travels to a store location to take possession of the order items.

## Pickup method 

_Pickup method_ is a concept analogous to _shipping method_. It allows merchants to customize the pickup options that display at checkout with an additional description and display text, beyond the basic address details defined by the associated location. Pickup methods allow merchants to set up multiple different pickup options for a single location, such as offering both in-store pickup and curbside pickup. 

## Routing 

_Routing_ refers to the process of determining which inventory locations to use as fulfillment sources for line items within a cart, checkout, and order. 

At launch, the _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ feature does not manage routing; however, an implementation might use the Inventory and Locations APIs to externally impose consistent routing logic. 

## Safety Stock 

The quantity of product that is stored to prevent the inadvertent sale of an out-of-stock item. It serves as insurance against sudden or rapid fluctuations in demand. 

Safety stock quantity is not included in the _available to sell_ quantity that may be displayed to customers on the storefront. 

## Warning Level 

_Warning level_ is the same as the `inventory_warning_level` attribute in the Catalog API.
