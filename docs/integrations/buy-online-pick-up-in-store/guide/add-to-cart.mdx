# Implementing an Add to Cart Flow for Buy Online, Pick up in Store 

Many online brands allow shoppers to choose pick up or ship directly from the product details page. 

This can reduce friction for shoppers who already have a preferred local store, or for whom you can estimate the location of their local store. These shoppers can add to cart and lock in a pickup location in one click. 

Depending on the payment options available, the shopper could then complete Checkout in just a couple of clicks.

You will need to customize a store's Theme to display appropriate options based on the desired experience.

You will need to interact with both the Cart and Checkout APIs to take advantage of the new _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ features in BigCommerce. This is needed whether you implement dropdown, radio buttons, or separate buttons to select between shipping or pickup.

Use the [Carts API](/docs/rest-storefront/carts) to add the item(s) to cart.

```http filename="Example request: Add cart line items" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://{store_domain}/api/storefront/carts/{cartId}/items
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  ...

  "lineItems": [
    {
      "quantity": 1,
      "productId": 5,
      "variantId": 55
    }
  ]

  ...
}
```

This returns line item ids which will need to be referenced in subsequent calls.

```json filename="Example response: Add cart line items" showLineNumbers copy
{
...
  "lineItems": {
    "physicalItems": [
      {
        "id": 20, // line item id
        "quantity": 1,
        "productId": 5,
        "variantId": 55,
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
...
}
```

Next, use the updated [Checkout API](/docs/rest-storefront/checkouts) to create or use an existing Consignment. If the shopper wants to pick up their items, use the `id` retrieved from [Find available pickup options](/docs/rest-storefront/pickup-options#find-available-pickup-options) for the `pickupMethodId`.

```http filename="Example request: Add consignment to checkout" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://{store_domain}/api/storefront/checkouts/{checkoutId}/consignments
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

[
  ...

  "lineItems": [
    {
      itemId: 20,
      quantity: 1
    }
  ]
  "pickupOption": {
    "pickupMethodId": 1
    }
  "address": []
]
```


You can continue to modify Consignment using the Checkout API, updating the selected pickup option or even switching the Consignment back to a "shipping" type.
