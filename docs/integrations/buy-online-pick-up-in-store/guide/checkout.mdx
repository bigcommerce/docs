# Building a Buy Online, Pick up in Store-friendly Checkout Experience

You can customize the checkout to tailor the shopper experience depending on whether the shopper chooses shipping or a Pickup fulfillment method.

If you want to create a _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ experience on top of our existing Optimized One-Page Checkout, you can [install a custom checkouts](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/open-checkouts/guide).

Alternatively, if you want to create a fully custom checkout experience that diverges significantly from our Optimized One-Page Checkout, use the [Checkout SDK](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/checkout-sdk) to interact with the Storefront Checkout APIs.
For info on incorporating BOPIS features, see the [Manage Checkout as a Shopper](/docs/integrations/buy-online-pick-up-in-store/end-to-end-guide/checkout) guide.

Regardless of which approach you choose, you can customize by doing the following:

- Remove the Shipping Address section for _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ flows
- Connect your middleware service to take additional _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ form fields
- Allow changing the pickup location within Checkout
- Allow toggling between shipping and _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ in Checkout

Use the [Storefront Checkout APIs](/docs/rest-storefront/checkouts) from your custom frontend implementation to interact with the BigCommerce Consignment model so that you can update shipping and pickup options that account for inventory levels.
