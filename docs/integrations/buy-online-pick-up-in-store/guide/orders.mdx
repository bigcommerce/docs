# Reading and Updating Order Fulfillment Info

You can manage inventory at multiple locations and offer _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ functionality for shoppers.

In _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ solutions, Orders use Consignments, which represent collections of line items and a fulfillment method. The fulfillment method can be one of `shipping`, `pickup`, or `digital` in the case of digital products.

You can integrate your existing backend with BigCommerce's _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ offering using our new and updated APIs.

You may also continue to use the current API in a backwards compatible way without using _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ features.

Use the updated [Orders V2 API](/docs/rest-management/orders) to query or update fulfillment information on orders. This will maintain consistent inventory levels across your defined locations.

Use the [Locations API](/docs/rest-management/locations) to query detailed inventory levels and address information from a store's locations.
