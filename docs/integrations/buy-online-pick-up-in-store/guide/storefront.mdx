# Adding Buy Online, Pick up in Store Features to the Storefront

You can enhance the storefront browsing experience by letting shoppers see and select a Pickup fulfillment method.

The biggest benefit is that shoppers can see product inventory availability by location. This helps inform their shopping decisions.

Adding inventory data experiences can be achieved by customizing a store's theme to query the [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql) and display the appropriate components for availability. 

The [Query Locations with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/locations/queries) and [Query Inventory with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/inventory/queries) pages contain info about what has been added to the API to support _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ features. 

The following example shows how you can show inventory for the base product and its variants using [Stencil](/docs/storefront/stencil):

1. Add the following [GraphQL attribute](/docs/storefront/stencil/themes/context/frontmatter-reference#graphql-attributes) to the [Stencil Front Matter](/docs/storefront/stencil/themes/context/frontmatter) of the `product.html` page:

```graphql showLineNumbers copy
gql: "query($productId: Int!) {
  site {
    product(entityId: $productId) {
      name
      inventory {
        aggregated {
          availableToSell
        }
      }
      variants {
        edges {
          node {
            sku
            inventory {
              aggregated {
                availableToSell
              }
              byLocation {
                edges {
                  node {
                    locationEntityCode
                    availableToSell
                    isInStock
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}"
```

2. Add the following handlebars to the `product-view.html` page:

```handlebars showLineNumbers copy
{{#if gql.data.site.product}}

<b>Available to Sell:</b> {{gql.data.site.product.inventory.aggregated.availableToSell}} <br></br>

{{#each gql.data.site.product.variants.edges}}
    {{#with node}}

        <b>Variant SKU: </b> {{sku}} <br></br>
        Total Available to Sell: {{inventory.aggregated.availableToSell}} <br></br>                     

        {{#each inventory.byLocation.edges}}
        {{#with node}}

        {{#if isInStock}}
        {{locationEntityCode}} has {{availableToSell}} in stock <br></br>
        {{/if}}   
            
        {{/with}}
        {{/each}}
    {{/with}}
{{/each}}

{{/if}}
```
