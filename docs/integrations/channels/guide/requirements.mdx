# Channel App Requirements

Once approved, channel apps are discoverable on BigCommerce's App Marketplace. Additionally, apps developed by [select partners](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/) are marketed in the Channel Manager within the Control Panel of every store. To be approved, channel apps must meet certain requirements. This article lists the requirements for publishing channel apps to both locations.

## General requirements

All Partners:

- Uses [Channels API](/docs/rest-management/channels).

- [Creates a channel](/docs/rest-management/channels#create-a-channel) upon app installation.
- Reads and updates channel status using the [Channels API](/docs/rest-management/channels) endpoints.

- Follows requirements for specific channel type

- Contains an onboarding user flow

Select Partners:

- Uses [BigDesign](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design).

## Storefronts

All Partners:

- Must use [Sites and Routes API](/docs/rest-management/sites) so that links generated within BigCommerce, such as "view storefront" and links sent in transactional emails to shoppers, will use the headless storefront's correct URL.

## Marketplaces and marketing

All Partners:

- Must use [Listings API](/docs/rest-management/channels), if supporting per product listings.
