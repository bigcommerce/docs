# B2B Edition Webhooks

B2B Edition is BigCommerce’s all-in-one solution that offers enterprise-level B2B functionality to businesses of all types and sizes. It enables business owners to facilitate their B2B operations online and to provide customers with self-service account capabilities and seamless transactions.

This page is a reference for B2B Edition webhooks and it assumes that you're familiar with webhooks. For a general introduction to webhooks, see [Webhooks Overview](/docs/integrations/webhooks).

**Note:** B2B Edition currently does not support storefront channel-specific webhooks.

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook, send a request to the [Create a webhook](/docs/webhooks/webhooks/manage-webhooks-bulk#create-a-webhook) endpoint. You must use a BigCommerce store- or app-level API account to authenticate the request; it does not support the API tokens created in your [B2B Edition API Account settings](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/B2B-Edition-Settings). Your API account must have the **B2B Edition** scope set to *modify*.

The following example creates a webhook that subscribes to creation events for Company accounts.

```http filename="Example request: Create a webhook" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/hooks
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "scope": "store/company/created", 
  "destination": "https://example.com/webhooks", // replace with your HTTPS endpoint URL
  "is_active": true
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  
  * The `destination` URL must be served on port **443**; custom ports are not currently supported.  
  * It can take up to one minute for a newly created webhook to work.
</Callout>

For information on creating a webhook, consult the [creating a webhook section of the Webhooks Overview](/docs/integrations/webhooks#creating-a-webhook).

## Callback structure

For information on webhook callback payload properties, see [Webhook Events](/docs/integrations/webhooks/events#callback-structure).

## Company Addresses

|:------------------------|:------------|
| store/company/address/created | Fires when a new Company address is saved to a Company in the storefront, from the B2B Edition control panel, or via the API. |
