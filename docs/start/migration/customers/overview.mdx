# Transferring Your Customers to BigCommerce

## Customer data migration: Best practices and process overview

Customer information can be transferred to a BigCommerce store via the API. This guide outlines the recommended process for migrating customers with minimal dependencies on CSV import.

We recommend migrating customers in the following order:

1. Prepare prerequisites
2. Create customers
3. Validate and finalize

## Migration Steps

### 1. Preparing for customer migration

Before you begin, decide on the following:

#### Passwords

Passwords can be set via API using the `authentication` object when creating customers:
[`POST /customers`](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/customers#create-customers)

Options:

1. **Preferred method**: Create customers without a password and notify them to reset using a password reset link.
2. **Alternative**: Provide a password during creation by including the `authentication` object. Example:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com",
	"authentication": {
		"force_reset": true,
		"new_password": "TempPass123"
	}
}
```

Setting `force_reset: true` ensures customers must update their password at first login.

#### Customer groups

- Customer groups must be created in the control panel before migration.
- Customers can be assigned to groups during creation (customer_group_id) or afterward via API.
- Each customer can belong to only one group.

<Callout type='info'>
	Use CSV import only if you need to bulk-assign groups in one action.
	Otherwise, use the API.
</Callout>

#### Channels / Multi-Storefront

- Decide whether customers have global or channel-specific access.
- Channels must be created in the control panel before migration.
- Customers without a channel assignment default to global access.

### 2. Migrate customer data

#### Rate limits

<Callout type='info'>
	Create up to 10 customers per `POST /v3/customers` call; implement backoff
	using the rate-limit headers.
</Callout>

BigCommerce APIs are subject to rate limits. Always design your migration to:

- Batch requests where possible
- Implement retries with exponential backoff
- Monitor headers: `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`

#### Create customers

<Callout>
	Tip: You can assign `store_credit_amounts` when creating customers. If
	omitted, you can add it later with `PUT /customers/{id}`.
</Callout>

minimum required fields:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`

Use the [`POST /customers`](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/customers#create-customers) endpoint to create customers. Include all required fields and any optional fields needed.

Example minimal request body:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

Example request body:

```json
{
	"email": "jane.doe@example.com",
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"company": "Acme Corp",
	"phone": "512-555-1234",
	"notes": "VIP customer",
	"customer_group_id": 2,
	"addresses": [
		{
			"address1": "Addr 1",
			"address2": "",
			"address_type": "residential",
			"city": "San Francisco",
			"company": "History",
			"country_code": "US",
			"first_name": "Ronald",
			"last_name": "Swimmer",
			"phone": "707070707",
			"postal_code": "33333",
			"state_or_province": "California",
			"form_fields": [
				{
					"name": "Delivery Instructions",
					"value": "Leave at front desk"
				}
			]
		}
	],
	"authentication": {
		"force_password_reset": true,
		"new_password": "string123"
	},
	"store_credit_amounts": [
		{
			"amount": 43.15
		}
	],
	"channel_ids": [1, 2],
	"form_fields": [
		{
			"name": "Delivery Instructions",
			"value": "Leave at front desk"
		}
	]
}
```

### 3. Post-migration tasks

- Trigger password reset emails (if customers were created without passwords).
- Verify login across channels.
- Spot-check customer group assignments and store credit.
- Confirm that custom fields and preferences are correctly associated.
