# Transferring Your Customers to BigCommerce

## Customer data migration: Best practices and process overview

Customer information can be transferred to a BigCommerce store via the [REST Management API](/docs/rest-management/customers). This guide outlines the recommended process for migrating customers.

**API endpoint:** [`POST /customers`](/docs/rest-management/customers#create-customers)

Customer creation, at minimum, requires only 3 fields:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`

**Minimal request body:**

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

## API Rate Limits for Customer Migration

You can create up to 10 customers per `POST /v3/customers` call and implement retry logic
using the rate-limit headers.

### Best Practices for API Rate Limits

1. **Batch Requests**: Create up to 10 customers per API call to maximize efficiency
2. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Check `X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left` before making requests
3. **Implement Retry Logic**: Use exponential backoff when receiving `429` responses
4. **Distribute Load**: Spread requests over time rather than making them in bursts

### Example: Batch Customer Creation

```json

	{
		"first_name": "Henry",
		"last_name": "Rodriguez",
		"email": "henry@example.com"
	}
]
```

```javascript
async function createCustomers(customerData) {
	const response = await fetch(
		'https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/customers',
		{
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				'X-Auth-Token': 'your_access_token',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify(customerData),
		}
	)

	// Handle rate limiting
	if (response.status === 429) {
		const resetTime = response.headers.get('X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms')
		const waitTime = resetTime ? parseInt(resetTime) : 1000

		console.log(`Rate limited. Waiting ${waitTime}ms before retry`)
		await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime))

		// Retry the request
		return createCustomers(customerData)
	}

	return response
}
```

## Customer Creation Options

There are options to consider when creating customers based on your needs. In this section we cover:

- Password Management
- Customer Groups
- Customer Addresses
- Multi-Storefront (Channels)

Let's cover each option in detail.

### Password Management

Due to PCI compliance, you cannot migrate passwords. This means you can either create customers without passwords and send password reset emails after migration or set a password during creation.

#### Preferred: No password (password reset required)

Create customers without passwords and send password reset emails after migration:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

After migration, send a password reset email to each customer. You can use your preferred email service to send a generic email to all users with instructions to reset their password using the storefront login page.

#### Alternative: Set password during creation

<Callout type='warning'>
	If you set a password during creation, ensure each user gets a unique
	password. Using the same password for multiple accounts creates a security
	risk. We recommend sending password reset emails instead of setting passwords
	during creation.
</Callout>

To set a temporary password, include the `authentication` object with `force_password_reset: true` and `new_password`:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com",
	"authentication": {
		"force_password_reset": true,
		"new_password": "string123"
	}
}
```

### Customer Groups

Customer groups allow you to organize customers and control product visibility, pricing, and checkout options. Each customer can belong to only one group.

**Key points for migration:**

- Customer groups must be created in the control panel before migration (cannot be created via API)
- Assign customers to groups using the `customer_group_id` field during creation
- Groups control which products customers can see and purchase

**Example with customer group assignment:**

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com",
	"customer_group_id": 1
}
```

For detailed information about creating and managing customer groups, see [Customer Groups](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Customer-Groups?language=en_US#how) in the BigCommerce support documentation.

### Customer Addresses

Customer addresses can be included during customer creation. Each address has specific required fields that must be provided.

**Required fields for addresses:**

- `address1` - Street address line 1
- `city` - City name
- `country_code` - Two-letter country code (e.g., "US", "CA", "GB")
- `first_name` - First name for the address
- `last_name` - Last name for the address
- `postal_code` - ZIP/postal code
- `state_or_province` - State or province name

**Example with minimal address:**

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com",
	"addresses": [
		{
			"address1": "123 Main St",
			"city": "San Francisco",
			"country_code": "US",
			"first_name": "Jane",
			"last_name": "Doe",
			"postal_code": "94105",
			"state_or_province": "California"
		}
	]
}
```

### Multi-Storefront (Channels)

**Requirements:**

- Channels must be created in the control panel before migration
- Customers without a channel assignment default to global access

**Example with minimal payload:**

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane@example.com",
	"channel_ids": [1, 2]
}
```

## Complete Example

Here is a comprehensive example showing a customer created with:

- A temporary password (with forced reset)
- Assignment to customer group 1
- A minimal address (required fields only)
- Assignment to channels 1 and 2

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jane",
	"last_name": "Doe",
	"email": "jane.doe@example.com",
	"customer_group_id": 1,
	"addresses": [
		{
			"address1": "123 Main St",
			"city": "San Francisco",
			"country_code": "US",
			"first_name": "Jane",
			"last_name": "Doe",
			"postal_code": "94105",
			"state_or_province": "California"
		}
	],
	"authentication": {
		"force_password_reset": true,
		"new_password": "string123"
	},
	"channel_ids": [1, 2]
}
```
