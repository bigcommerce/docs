# Product data migration: Best practices and process overview

Migrating product data is a foundational part of launching or replatforming an ecommerce store. This section provides practical guidance and best practices for migrating your product catalog into BigCommerce, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and minimizing common migration errors.

## Why focus on data migration?

Product data migration affects core areas of your storefront, including product listings, search, inventory, pricing, and overall customer experience. Early planning and process validation help reduce the risk of errors and delays during launch. The following pages walk through the technical and operational steps of migration to support a smooth transition.

## Getting started

<Callout type="info">
Data migration is complex and impacts your entire store setup. You should plan for it early in your project timeline to prevent setbacks.

### Recommended preparatory tasks

- **Test your migration workflow early**  
  Once you have defined your migration plan and scope, test your migration process in a non-production environment. Address any issues found during testing before moving to a full migration.

- **Align store settings and source data**  
  Before importing product data, configure your storeâ€™s [store settings](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-Settings) including product weight units, dimensions, currency, and timezone. Check that your source data matches these settings to avoid inconsistencies.

- **Configure categories and brands in advance**  
  Categories and brands must be created in BigCommerce before importing products. Category and brand assignments are done by numeric ID, not by name. Prepare a mapping between your source data and BigCommerce IDs to ensure products are assigned correctly. See the [Catalog API Reference](/docs/rest-catalog) for details.

<Callout type="info">
Category and brand IDs are not accessible by name, so create and cache a mapping schema to guarantee your catalog is properly configured.
