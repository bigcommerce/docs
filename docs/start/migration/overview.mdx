# Catalog data migration: Best practices and process overview

Now that you've made the decision to move your store to BigCommerce, it's time to start the logistics of transferring your catalog. Recognizing that there is no single solution that will fit every business, we support several ways to migrate your data, ranging from our data migration apps to completely managed transfers through BigCommerce's Data Migration Services team.

Factors such as ease of use, number of SKUs, orders and sales history, and custom product fields are key considerations to take into account before selecting a migration method.

#### DATA MIGRATION APPS

Our data migration apps allow you to migrate your catalog data resources (products, categories, customers, orders) into your new BigCommerce store from the following platforms:

- [Shopify](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/data-migration-services-shopify/)
- [Volusion](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/data-migration-volusion/)
- [WooCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/data-migration-services-woocommerce/)
- [Magento](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/data-migration-services-magento/)
- [Zen Cart](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/data-migration-services-zen-cart/)
- [Yahoo](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/data-migration-services-yahoo/)

The demo versions of these apps are available in the App Marketplace, and are free to use for the first 1,000 resources. After this limit has been reached, there is a fee for transferring additional resources using the full app. Use the in-app contact form for more information.

Ideal for those new to BigCommerce, the data migration apps should be the first step in relaunching your store on the BigCommerce platform. As the apps make a copy of your current store's catalog, they do not affect your live store. While each app has its own requirements specific to the hosting platform, they all require that:

- Your current store is accessible from the Internet
- You have full administrative access to your current store's control panel

Any data stored in plug-ins or extensions will most likely not be included in the transfer, and would need to be added manually or by CSV import afterwards. If you have any data you need to preserve inside your BigCommerce store,
we suggest [exporting it](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Backing-Up-Your-Store) to create a backup copy before starting the transfer.

Basic customer details, such as name, email address, phone number, and physical addresses will be transferred.
However, since passwords can't be exported from most platforms for PCI compliance, customers are transferred with a
feature flag that requires them to reset their password the next time they attempt to log in.

#### CSV IMPORT

As an alternative, you can import your [products](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Legacy-Import-Export-Overview) and [customers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Importing-Exporting-Customers/#import) into your BigCommerce store by using a CSV file. Keep in mind that you will
likely need to reformat your source CSV file so that it can be imported successfully into your BigCommerce store. Spreadsheet programs
such as Excel or Google Sheets are necessary in order to edit CSV files. For stores with less than 10,000 SKUs,
we recommend using one of our data migration apps for migrating your products, and then using a CSV import to clean up your product data.

#### MANAGED DATA MIGRATION

If you don't feel comfortable migrating your store's data using the app or CSV file, consider using a managed data transfer through BigCommerce's [Data Migration Services](https://www.bigcommerce.com/services/launch/) team. They will work directly with you to ensure that your data is securely migrated to your satisfaction, tailoring their services to match your business needs. The team is highly experienced in working with large catalogs with SKUs on more than 50 ecommerce platforms.
They are also able to handle custom migration requests to best meet the needs of your store's architecture. [Contact us](https://www.bigcommerce.com/request-quote/) to request a quote.

#### API

Developers can use our Catalog, Orders, and Customers API to add and modify products, orders, and customer data directly. See our [API Documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs) on the Dev Center for more detailed information and examples.

  **How do I ensure that imported historical orders aren't counted as new orders or GMV?**<br/>
  When migrating orders from a previous platform, which involves [creating new orders via API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/orders#create-an-order),
  use M-MIG in the external_source field to exclude these orders from affecting your store's [trailing 12-month sales volume](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Pricing).
  These orders do not deduct product stock and will bypass quantity requirements.
