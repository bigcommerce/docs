# Catalog data migration: Best practices and process overview

Migrating catalog data is a foundational part of launching or replatforming an ecommerce store. This section provides practical guidance and best practices for migrating your catalog into BigCommerce, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and minimizing common migration errors.

There are several methods to migrating your catalog data into BigCommerce. This migration guide focuses on using our REST and/or GraphQL APIs.

## Why focus on data migration?

Catalog data migration affects categories, brands, products, customers, B2B properties, orders, and overall customer experience.
Early planning and process validation help reduce the risk of errors and delays during launch. The following pages walk through the technical and operational steps of migration using our APIs to support a smooth transition.

## Migration order

Some data types have dependencies that require a specific order. For example, products must be assigned to existing categories and brands, so categories and brands should be created first.

We recommend migrating your data in the following order:

- Categories
- Brands
- Products
- Customers
- B2B Properties
- Orders

## Getting started

### Create API Tokens

For initial migration, it can be helpful to establish a single token with all the scopes required for a complete data transfer.
Before getting started, make sure you have a Store-Level API token with the following scopes:

| Scope                 | Modify |
| --------------------- | :----: |
| Customers             |   X    |
| Orders                |   X    |
| Products              |   X    |
| Storefront API tokens |   X    |

You can create and manage API tokens in your BigCommerce control panel under **Settings** > **API** > **Store-level API accounts**.
Once there, select the "Create API account" button in the upper right hand corner.

For more information on API accounts see our [Guide to API accounts](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts) documentation.

### Prepare store for migration

Before importing product data, configure your store's [store settings](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-Settings) including product weight units, dimensions, currency, and timezone. Check that your source data matches these settings to avoid inconsistencies.
