# Catalog data migration: Best practices and process overview

Migrating catalog data is a foundational part of launching or replatforming an ecommerce store. This section provides practical guidance and best practices for migrating your catalog into BigCommerce, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and minimizing common migration errors.

There are several methods to migrating your catalog data into BigCommerce. These sections focus on using our APIs. For other methods like CSV import,
Data Migration Apps, and Managed Transfer Services, please refer to our knowledge base article, [Transferring Your Catalog to BigCommerce](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Transferring-Your-Catalog-to-BigCommerce?language=en_US).

## Why focus on data migration?

Catalog data migration affects products, categories, customers, orders, and overall customer experience.
Early planning and process validation help reduce the risk of errors and delays during launch. The following pages walk through the technical and operational steps of migration using our APIs to support a smooth transition.

## Migration order

We recommend migrating your data in the following order:

- Categories
- Brands
- Products
- Customers
- B2B Properties
- Orders

### Recommended preparatory tasks

{/* TODO: List of preparatory tasks */}

- **Test your migration workflow early**
  Once you have defined your migration plan and scope, test your migration process in a non-production environment. Address any issues found during testing before moving to a full migration.

- **Align store settings and source data**
  Before importing product data, configure your store's [store settings](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-Settings) including product weight units, dimensions, currency, and timezone. Check that your source data matches these settings to avoid inconsistencies.

- **Configure categories and brands in advance**
  Categories and brands must be created in BigCommerce before importing products. Category and brand assignments are done by numeric ID, not by name. Prepare a mapping between your source data and BigCommerce IDs to ensure products are assigned correctly. See the [Catalog API Reference](/docs/rest-catalog) for details.
