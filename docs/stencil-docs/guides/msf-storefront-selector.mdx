# Changing the Storefront Selector


Currently there is no Stencil object for the Storefront Selector. Therefore, as a temporary solution, the data was added to the `config.json` file and in this way it will appear in the `theme_settings` Stencil object.

In order to change the data for the Selector, you need to clone the Cornerstone repository, install the necessary project dependencies, change the data for the Selector, and run the project build to get the bundle that should be uploaded to the Control Panel.

<Callout type="info">
- We cannot change the data for the Selector in config.json directly in the Control Panel Editor, because this file is read-only. For more info, see the []() support article.
- We cannot manually change the bundle, because the bundle must have a specific Stencil format, which is created only during the automatic build. For more info, see the []() support article.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Cloning the GitHub repository
To clone the Cornerstone repository, run the command below in the terminal of your OS:

```
git clone https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone.git
```

## Step 2: Install Stencil-CLI

Open the cloned repository in any code editor (IDE). Open your IDE-terminal (from now we work with IDE-terminal). Depending on the operating system you are using, install the Stencil CLI that should be supported by the appropriate version of Node.js.
To verify the success of the Stencil CLI installation, run the command below in the terminal:

```
stencil -V
```

If you did everything correctly, you will see the Stencil CLI version in the terminal.



## Step 3: Installing theme modules, initializing and running the project locally

To install the modules, run the command in the terminal

```
npm install
```

After successfully installing modules, the node_modules folder will appear in the root of the project. 

Run the following commands to initialize and run the project:

```
stencil init
```

To execute this command, you will need a link to your store, Stencil Access Token, and a port on which your local project will run. After successful initialization, a secrets.stencil.json file (containing the token) will appear in the root of the project.

Run the command to start the project locally

```
stencil start
```

Go to the local link in the terminal to open your project in the browser.


## Step 4: Changing the Storefront Selector

Open the config.json file and edit the necessary Storefront Selector data. To display the Selector in the browser, change the `show_channels` key to true and save the changes. By default, this key is set to false. This key can also be configured in the Page Builder. Refresh the browser page to reflect the changes.


## Step 5: Creating a bundle with new changes

After making changes in the Selector, make sure that everything is displayed correctly in the browser. Then run the command below to build the project bundle with the new changes:

```
stencil bundle
```

After a successful build, a zip file will appear in the project root with the theme name and version, for example Cornerstone-6.14.0.zip.


## Step 6: Upload the bundle to the Control Panel

To upload the bundle with the updated Selector, go to the Control Panel, find the Storefront tab and click the Upload button. Select the bundle created in the previous step and upload it.
Apply the bundle and open your store. If the Selector is not displayed, go to **Page Builder > Theme Styles > Header and Footer > Utility navigation > Show storefront selector** and check this checkbox. Save the changes and refresh the store.
