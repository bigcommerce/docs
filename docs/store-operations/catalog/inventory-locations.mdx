# Locations

_Locations_ allow merchants to track product inventory across multiple physical or virtual locations. 
Locations also allow merchants to manage their store and warehouse physical addresses in a single source of truth, which can be used by tools such as store locator widgets or app integrations concerned with locations where a storeâ€™s business is conducted. 

**Default behavior:** By default, Stencil's native storefront and locations queries support stock levels from only the _default_ location. If the default location runs out of stock, the product will be considered out of stock on the storefront, even if there is inventory in other locations.

**Alternate behavior:** By request, your store can instead use Aggregated stock, where stock from _all locations_ is summed up for Stencil's storefront and location queries. This means that if the default location has a stock of 0, but another location has a stock greater than 0, the product will still be considered in stock. If you would like to enable Aggregated stock, please contact our support team.

## Managing locations

You can create up to the following number of locations:
- Standard plan: up to 4
- Plus plan: up to 5
- Pro plan: up to 8
- Enterprise plan: 100; can be customized by request

You can disable, remove visibility, and [delete locations](/docs/rest-management/locations#delete-locations).

The `enabled` and `storefront_visibility` flags for a location determine whether a location is available for Storefront and Management APIs.
- Both flags determine if a location will return through any of the Storefront APIs, including getting available pickup methods. The flags control location visibility through the Storefront APIs.
- However, the `enabled` flag also controls:
    - Whether a location can be used to create orders and pickup methods. 
    - Whether you can edit stock levels through the management APIs
    - If any stock for products at a location contribute to the "available to sell" total returned by the Storefront APIs.  
- For example, a location can be "enabled", allowing orders to be fulfilled at that location through the Order V2 or Checkout APIs. If its `storefront_visibility` is set to false, the details of that location are omitted from the Storefront APIs.

The [Locations API](/docs/rest-management/locations) allows you to manage locations. For examples, see [Merchant Configuration](/docs/integrations/buy-online-pick-up-in-store/end-to-end-guide/configuration) under the End-to-end guides.

You can query locations using the GraphQL Storefront API. For examples, see [Query Locations with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/locations/queries). 

<Callout type="info">
  Due to the asynchronous nature of the Locations API, there may be a short delay before data is updated after the endpoints are called. Endpoints that manage these locations and inventory at these locations return a `transaction_id` for any write requests.
</Callout>

### Location metafields

Manage location metafields using the [Locations API](/docs/rest-management/locations).

To create a location metafield, send a request to the [Create a location metafield](/docs/rest-management/locations/metafields#create-a-metafield) endpoint. Each metafield must have a unique combination of `key` and `value` for a `namespace`.

    },
      "meta": {}
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

Location metafields that have storefront access permissions (i.e. permission set as `read_and_sf_access` or `write_and_sf_access`) can be returned in the GraphQL Storefront API.
For example queries of this, see [Query Locations with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/locations/queries).
