_International Enhancements for Multi-Storefront_ allow merchants to deliver localized experiences to fit different shopper needs. You can express product details differently across cultures and countries.
For example, when selling products internationally, you can add information for products in various languages. 
Shoppers can then see key product details in the language of their choice throughout the complete checkout and post-order experience for a personalized shopping experience.
This personalized shopping experience helps shoppers find and learn information about a product before purchasing. 

The following pages provide sample queries:

- [Basic product information](/docs/store-operations/catalog/graphql-admin/product-basic-info)
- [Product SEO information](/docs/store-operations/catalog/graphql-admin/product-seo-info)
- [Product variant options](/docs/store-operations/catalog/graphql-admin/product-variant-options)
- [Product modifier options](/docs/store-operations/catalog/graphql-admin/product-modifier-options)
- [Product URL](/docs/store-operations/catalog/graphql-admin/product-url)
- [Additional product attributes](/docs/store-operations/catalog/graphql-admin/product-attributes)

You can create webhooks that trigger for the following events:
- [Product updated](/docs/integrations/webhooks/events#products)
- [Product or shared option updated](/docs/integrations/webhooks/events#options)
- [Product or shared modifier updated](/docs/integrations/webhooks/events#modifiers)
- [Product custom fields updated](/docs/integrations/webhooks/events#products)

## Use cases

To use these features, set product attributes to locales within storefront channels. This update overrides global product attributes.
Product attributes you can customize include the product name, description, variant options, modifier options, and SEO settings.

This allows you to perform the following:  

- Customize product name and description for culture or language
- Optimize SEO or display product options and variations based on country
- Create additional brands to position the same product to multiple market segments and shopper personas
- Tailor product content for different countries that have different compliance regulations
- Display relevant seasonal or featured products   
- Enable two-way syncing of listings data to catalog between channels
