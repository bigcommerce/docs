# Multi-Currency Percentage Promotions 

You can configure the promotion to target all enabled transactional currencies when creating a promotion. The promotion will run regardless of what currency the shopper selects as transactional currency within the cart and checkout.

Multi-currency promotions intentionally only support percentage-based discounts (not amount-based discounts). You will not be able to create an amount-based promotion in multiple currencies. This choice prevents discounting based on fluctuating currency rates as some currencies have broader foreign exchange rates than others (for example, a 10 USD discount is substantially different from 10 JPY).

The following is an example of a coupon promotion offered to all international customers worldwide in their local transactional currency. The WELCOME10 coupon applies a 10% discount off the order, and you can digitally distribute the coupon through social media channels (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) or email marketing. Use the [Create a promotion](/docs/rest-management/promotions/promotions-bulk#create-promotion-beta) endpoint followed by the [Create a coupon code](/docs/rest-management/promotions/coupon-codes-single#create-a-coupon-code-beta) endpoint.
