<Callout type="info">
  #### Exclusive enterprise feature
  The Customer Segmentation API is available to enterprise customers. If you would like to become an enterprise customer, please contact your BigCommerce Customer Service Manager or our support team.
</Callout>

## Segment
An entity that classifies shoppers into groups or buckets, referred to as **segments**.

## Manual segment
A collection of shoppers that a merchant or application has grouped together using the API. Manual segments are not a distinct entity in our API; they are a subset of **segments**. 

## Shopper profile
An entity that represents a registered **customer**. Current plans for future releases include supporting **shopper profiles** for **guest** customers.

## Customer
An existing entity that represents a shopper who is registered with the store. In the Customer Segmentation API documentation, assume that **customers** are signed in to the subject storefront. For more on the **customer** entity, see the public [Customers API reference](/docs/rest-management/customers). 

## Guest
A shopper who is not signed in to the subject storefront. 

A **guest** may or may not be a registered **customer**, but because they are not signed in, your application doesn't know their registration status.

## Promotion
A way to give discounts based on whether the shopper meets specific criteria, such as ordering a certain amount, purchasing certain brands, being a repeat customer, or being associated with a **shopper profile** that belongs to a **segment**. 

For more on using **promotions** with **segments**, see [Targeting a segment with a promotion](/docs/store-operations/customer-segmentation/user-guide#targeting-a-segment-with-a-promotion). For more on the **promotion** entity, see the [Promotions documentation](/docs/store-operations/promotions).
