<Callout type="info">
  #### Exclusive enterprise feature

</Callout>

## Segment
An entity that classifies shoppers into groups or buckets, referred to as **segments**.

## Manual segment
A collection of shoppers that a merchant or application has grouped together using the API. Manual segments are not a distinct entity in our API; they are a subset of **segments**. 

## Shopper profile
An entity that represents a registered **customer**. Current plans for future releases include supporting **shopper profiles** for **guest** customers.

## Customer
An existing entity that represents a shopper who is registered with the store. In the Customer Segmentation API documentation, assume that **customers** are signed in to the subject storefront. For more on the **customer** entity, see the public [Customers API reference](/docs/rest-management/customers). 

## Guest
A shopper who is not signed in to the subject storefront. 

A **guest** may or may not be a registered **customer**, but because they are not signed in, your application doesn't know their registration status.

## Promotion
A way to give discounts based on whether the shopper meets specific criteria, such as ordering a certain amount, purchasing certain brands, being a repeat customer, or being associated with a **shopper profile** that belongs to a **segment**. 

For more on using **promotions** with **segments**, see [Targeting a segment with a promotion](/docs/store-operations/segments/user-guide#targeting-a-segment-with-a-promotion). For more on the **promotion** entity, see the [Promotions documentation](/docs/store-operations/promotions).
