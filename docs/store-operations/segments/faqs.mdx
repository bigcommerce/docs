# FAQ

## How will a promotion be applied to shoppers associated with a targeted segment? 
  
For a promotion to apply, you must assign a customer to the targeted segment, and they must sign in to the subject storefront. 

For automatic promotions, the discount automatically applies itself to the cart of each eligible signed-in customer. For coupon promotions, the signed-in customer must enter a valid coupon code associated with the promotion during checkout.


## Can you segment guests where customer_id=0? 
  
Not currently. This version of the Customer Segmentation API doesn’t support segmenting guest shoppers; only registered customers can be assigned to segments.


## How many segments are supported? 
  
We support up to 100 segments per **store**. The number of segments we support may increase due to the feedback we receive.


## What’s the difference between customer segments and customer groups? 
  
Customer groups allow you to group shoppers based on more permanent characteristics, like tax zones or shopper consent to collect GDPR-compliant data. A registered customer can only belong to one group at a time.

Customer segments provide greater flexibility. They leverage both the permanent and transient characteristics of a shopper to drive highly personalized shopping experiences. A [shopper profile](/docs/store-operations/customer-segmentation/definitions-and-relationships#shopper-profile) can belong to multiple segments.
