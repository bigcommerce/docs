# Shipping - International Enhancements for Multi-Storefront

When you sell internationally or to mulitple customer segments, you may want the available shipping methods for a shipping zone to depend on the shopper's region or segment.

To localize your storefront, you can have zones that display different methods depending on the storefront channel. 
When you create a method for a zone, specify which storefront channel(s) you want a shipping method to appear. Shoppers will only see the shipping method for the zone if it applies to a channel.

## Limitations

You can't assign the following to a specific channel:
- The free shipping method on [static shipping quotes](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Shipping-Methods#static).
- [Pickup methods](/docs/integrations/buy-online-pick-up-in-store#pickup-methods-api) on stores using Buy Online Pickup in Store.

We don't support multiple accounts of the same carrier (e.g., using distinct accounts for UPS)

## Settings

Shipping methods have a `channels` setting. This setting determines which channels can display the shipping zone's method. Shipping methods are available on all channels by default.

For reference, see the [Shipping method](/docs/rest-management/shipping-v2/shipping-method) endpoint of the REST Management API.

## Example

The following example creates a shipping method in a zone by sending a request to the [Create a shipping method](/docs/rest-management/shipping-v2/shipping-method#create-a-shipping-method) endpoint.
