# Customizing Printable Packing Slips

Developers frequently modify the default content of packing slips to satisfy specific business requirements and industry demands. This article contains instructions on how to edit the HTML file of a printable packing slip.

## Customizing printable packing slips

Customizing your Stencil theme’s printable packing slip relies on a template and variables from BigCommerce’s legacy Blueprint themes framework. To make changes to the packing slip file, follow these steps:


1. Download [printable packing slip .zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/packing_slip_printable.zip), which contains the HTML skeleton of a printable packing slip.

2. Make your customizations to the HTML file.

3. Upload your customized HTML file to the WebDAV’s `/template/` folder [using WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV). Ensure it is named `packing_slip_print.html` and replaces the default file, or WebDAV will not save your changes.

## Variables

The following variables are available within the printable packing slip template:

<Callout type="info">
* Some variables might be an empty string.
* LNG variables are fixed strings. If different text is desired, the LNG variables can be removed from the file and replaced with manually entered text. However, removing the LNG variables will impact translation functionality.

<Callout type="info">
The "Hide" variables are all used to selectively hide HTML elements depending on whether the content they have under them is available. You will need to wrap the "Hide" variables around specific variables, for example:
ShippingPhone (pairs with `HideShippingPhone`).
If you were to use `%%GLOBAL_ShippingPhone%%` somewhere, then it should be enclosed in an element that will hide it when not set, i.e.,
```<div style=%%GLOBAL_HideShippingPhone%%>Phone number: %%GLOBAL_ShippingPhone%%</div>.```
