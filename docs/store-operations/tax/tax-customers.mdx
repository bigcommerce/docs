# Tax Customers

The Tax Customers API allows merchants to configure customer-specific tax data for use in tax calculations. This enables merchants to provide tax providers with additional customer-related information that may affect tax rates or exemptions.

This guide demonstrates how to use the Tax Customers API. For more, see the [Tax Customers API Reference](/docs/rest-management/tax-customers).

## Tax customers

Tax customers rely on `customer_id` to associate tax data with specific customers. This data is sent to tax providers during tax calculations. The examples below demonstrate how to create, update, retrieve, and delete tax customer data.

### Get tax customers

To retrieve a list of tax customers, send a request to the [Get Tax Customers](/docs/rest-management/tax-customers#get-tax-customers) endpoint. You can filter the results by specifying one or more `customer_id` values.
