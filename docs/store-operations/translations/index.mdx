# Translations Admin GraphQL API (Beta)

## Overview
The Translations Admin GraphQL API is currently available on Catalyst storefronts only. It enables merchants to translate a single website into multiple languages, enhancing the shopper's experience by displaying category and location strings in their preferred language.

## Purpose and Benefits
The API helps merchants localize their storefronts efficiently, enabling a consistent shopping experience across multiple languages. This allows merchants to cater to a broader audience and expand market reach.

## Authentication and Access
Access to the Translations Admin GraphQL API requires valid API credentials. GraphQL Admin API endpoints use the X-Auth-Token header to authenticate to BigCommerce servers. To make a call to the Admin GraphQL, use an API client tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Ensure authentication tokens are included in requests.
