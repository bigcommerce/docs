# Deploying to Vercel

Before deploying your storefront, make sure to follow the [Local Development](https://www.catalyst.dev/docs/local-development) documentation. Alternatively, ensure you already have the appropriate [environment variables](https://www.catalyst.dev/environment-variables) set up as well as a source code repository.

To deploy to Vercel, you'll need to first [sign up or sign in to your Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup).

## Using the Vercel dashboard

To deploy to Vercel using the Vercel dashboard, select **Add New... > Project** from the top right of the Overview page.

Then, connect to the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket source repo that contains your Catalyst storefront's code.

Since we are deploying from a monorepo, we need to adjust some of the default Vercel deployment configuration. Update the following properties:

- **Framework Preset** - Next.js
- **Root Directory** - click **Edit** and select the `core/` folder.

You may leave the **Build and Output Settings** section as-is.

Next, you'll need to upload your [environment variables](#environment-variables). Then, click **Deploy**.

To learn more about deploying to Vercel, consult the [Vercel deployments overview](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview).

## Using the Vercel CLI

To deploy using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli), first install it by running `npm i -g vercel` or `pnpm i -g vercel`.

Next, in your terminal, navigate to the root of your project. Then, run `vercel` to create a preview deployment or `vercel --prod` to create a production deployment. If this is your first time using the Vercel CLI from this project, the CLI will take you through a few prompts to connect an existing Vercel project or create a new one, and you can use the answers below to help work through those prompts:

```
Vercel CLI 37.8.0
? Set up and deploy “~/path/to/my-catalyst-app”? yes
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? <YOUR_VERCEL_WORKSPACE>
? Link to existing project? no
? What’s your project’s name? my-catalyst-app
? In which directory is your code located? ./core
Local settings detected in vercel.json:
Auto-detected Project Settings (Next.js):
- Build Command: next build
- Development Command: next dev --port $PORT
- Install Command: `yarn install`, `pnpm install`, `npm install`, or `bun install`
- Output Directory: Next.js default
? Want to modify these settings? no
```

If you are creating a new Vercel project using the CLI, you need to add the environment variables; your first build will fail if no environment variables are populated. You can add the variables one at a time using [vercel env add](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/env), or sign in to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), choose your project, and add them there.

Once added, navigate back to your Vercel project, click **Deployments** and click **Redeploy** inside the ellipses dropdown menu. For more information on the Vercel CLI, consult the [Vercel CLI Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

## Editing in Makeswift

If you are using Makeswift, you'll need to update the **Host URL** property with the URL of your deployed site on Vercel. Vercel will automatically generate a URL for your project, but you'll probably be using your own custom domain. Regardless, you'll want to update the **Host URL** property within your production Makeswift site, not the development one. You can find this property under **Settings -> Host**. xln
