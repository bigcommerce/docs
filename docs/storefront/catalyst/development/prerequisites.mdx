# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the prerequisites listed below on your local machine.

### Node.js version `20.x`

Catalyst currently supports Node.js version `20.x` ([click here to download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))

### Corepack-enabled `pnpm`

Node.js version `20.x` ships with Corepack by default; you should be able to run `corepack enable` from your terminal to meet this prerequisite (more information on the [official Node.js Corepack documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/corepack.html))

### Git version `2.35.x` or later

### A BigCommerce store or sandbox

You can [create a trial store](https://bigcommerce.com/start-your-trial/) or [spin up a developer sandbox](https://start.bigcommerce.com/developer-sandbox/) to meet this prerequisite. If you already have a BigCommerce store, that will work fine too.

### Permission to create API accounts on your store

In order to allow Catalyst to authenticate with your BigCommerce store, you'll need to make sure that your user account on the subject store has been granted the `Create store-level API Accounts` permission detailed in our [documentation on High-Risk Permissions](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/User-Permissions#highrisk). If you are the assigned store owner of the store, you have these permissions implicitly.

### A GitHub account

You can sign up for a free GitHub account on the [official GitHub signup page](https://github.com/join).
