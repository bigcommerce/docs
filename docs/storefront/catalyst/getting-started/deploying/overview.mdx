# Deploying a Catalyst storefront

The Catalyst engineering team tests Catalyst against Vercel in normal development, but Catalyst is a standard Next.js application which can be hosted on most infrastructure providers that support Next.js. Consider the Next.js documentation or your hosting provider's documentation for guidance on how to deploy to your provider of choice.

Catalyst depends on the following Next.js features which must be supported by your hosting provider:

* [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)
* [Data Cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache)
* [Partial Prerendering (PPR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering)
* [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)

## Environment Variables

Regardless of where or how you deploy your Catalyst application, you'll need to get an updated set of environment variables to use. Assuming you've already run your application locally (follow the [Local Development](https://www.catalyst.dev/docs/local-development) guide for details), you can use the majority of the environment variables defined in your `env.local` file.

However, there are a couple of environment variables that need to be updated. Make sure to check the documentation for each one on how to update them accordingly.

* [`AUTH_SECRET`](/docs/storefront/catalyst/development/environment-variables#auth_secret)
* [`BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_TOKEN`](/docs/storefront/catalyst/development/environment-variables#bigcommerce_storefront_token)
* [`MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY`](/docs/storefront/catalyst/development/environment-variables#makeswift_site_api_key)
* [`TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY`](/docs/storefront/catalyst/development/environment-variables#turbo_remote_cache_signature_key)

For a full list of environment variables, refer to the [environment variables documentation](/docs/storefront/catalyst/development/environment-variables).
