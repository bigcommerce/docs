| Returns / RMA | 🔴 | Recommended to use partner solutions (e.g., Happy Returns, Returnly, Loop Returns, AfterShip). |
| App Support | 🟡 | Amount of effort required will vary depending on which type of app you have, but Catalyst compatibility for apps is possible now. Many apps already work with Catalyst, any app that exposes APIs can be integrated with some degree of effort (talk to your app developer), and we're actively investing in improved app integration methodologies in the future.<br/><br/>Additionally, once your app is Catalyst-compatible, you can submit your app for approval and get a "Catalyst" badge in the App Marketplace, similar to your "Multi-Storefront" badge.<br/><br/>To learn more about updating your app and submitting for compatibility approval, read our Building Catalyst compatible apps guide. |

Session cannot be synced from a Stencil checkout to a headless storefront. For example: you log in/out in Stencil then redirect back. There are plans to support in the future, but timing is TBD. |
| ADA Compliance | 🟢 | Our new design system for 1.0 was developed with constant Lighthouse testing for accessibility, but we are also commissioning a 3rd party accessibility audit and we will address any findings from that auditor. The audit results are expected in February. |
| B2B Open Source Buyer Portal | 🟢 | Existing B2B Buyer Portal functionality is available as an integration via https://www.catalyst.dev/docs/b2b. This, paired with existing support for Customer Groups means that Catalyst's B2B capabilities are very similar to Stencil's. A big priority for the 2025 roadmap is to provide Catalyst-native B2B components and Makeswift editability for the Buyer Portal. This work begins in February.<br/><br/>To learn more, check out our B2B Edition documentation. |
| Cookie Consent for GDPR/CCPA | 🟢 | |
| Customer Groups | 🟢 | Support for customer group product visibility and pricing, powered by our GraphQL API. |
| Google Analytics (GA4) | 🟢 | Integrated using BODL (Big Open Data Layer standard. Extendable for other analytics providers. |
| Multi-storefront | 🟢 | Catalyst is structured as a single-domain Next.js application, so it can only serve one domain per project out of the box. However, you can deploy multiple projects to serve multiple domains (similar to one-theme-per-domain on Stencil), and you can also wire up subpaths of the domain on Catalyst to serve either multi-language or separate channels. So, Catalyst exceeds Stencil in terms of the MSF scenarios it supports. Next.js itself does support multi-domain deployments and Catalyst could be customized to do this.<br/><br/>To learn more, check out the Catalyst Multi-storefront Guide |
| My Account / Orders | 🟢 | Supports profiles, addresses, and order history. Tracking links not included yet; downloadable product links not supported. |
| Native Analytics | 🟢 | We support three server-side sent events which are triggered in Catalyst middleware: visitStartedEvent, pageViewedEvent, and productViewedEvent. |
| Native Newsletter Subscription | 🟢 | |
| PCI Compliance | 🟢 | Today, no payments information touches the Next.js application due to the use of redirected checkout, so the Next.js layer is kept out of PCI scope for the most part. As we figure out the path to add Saved Payment Methods into the My Account area, we will approach this with an embedded/iframe based approach to provide similar guarantees. |
| Persistent Cart | 🟢 | Login mutation will be extended to automatically restore and merge carts just like Stencil. |
| Promotions | 🟢 | Promotional logic works in cart; some promo banners are not yet supported (separate item). |
| Scripts API | 🟢 | Although we don't think frontend script injection is the right way for most solutions to integrate into Catalyst - we think most people would be better served by writing Server Components - we have added Scripts into GraphQL Storefront API so they can be rendered in Catalyst when it does make sense, such as for analytics pixels. |
| Single Storefront Multi-currency | 🟢 | Added in #1912, only supports transactional currencies for now, not display-only currencies. |
| Single Storefront Multi-geo | 🟢 | |
| Single Storefront Multi-Lang | 🟢 | Supports: static string translation via language files, translated product catalog (either within a single channel, or across channels) via localized subpaths, uses next-intl as localization framework, localization of content pages when built with Makeswift using Makeswift's existing localization capabilities.<br/><br/>To learn more, check out our Catalyst Multi-Language Guide |
| Synchronized login state between storefront and checkout; global logout | 🟢 | Enabled through Customer Access Token (CAT) used in Catalyst by default. |
| Visual Editing (Page Builder equivalent) | 🟢 | As of 1.0 Makeswift is deeply integrated into Catalyst on a distributable version of Catalyst; customers have the choice of either using Makeswift or selecting a version of Catalyst with no editor built in. |
| Wishlists | 🟢 | Wishlists are now available, see the documentation here. |
