# One-Click Catalyst

One-Click Catalyst simplifies the process of setting up a fully customizable headless ecommerce storefront with BigCommerce. It not only creates a storefront but also deploys a hosted preview and provisions a corresponding site in BigCommerce’s visual editor, [Makeswift](https://makeswift.com/).

This code-free starting point allows marketers and content authors to explore Catalyst's features and Makeswift's design capabilities without needing a developer. Specifically, you’ll be able to:

- Customize site theme and design
- Create and edit layouts
- Create and edit pages
- Incorporate BigCommerce product data

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that the automatically deployed storefront is only intended to be used
  for previewing your storefront, so you’ll need to follow our
  [deploying](/docs/storefront/catalyst/getting-started/deploying/vercel) documentation to take your storefront to production.

After completing the initial One-click Catalyst setup in the BigCommerce dashboard you will have:

- An instance of Catalyst deployed to the BigCommerce partner sandbox account
- Two Makeswift sites
  - Production site - connected to the deployed Catalyst instance
  - Development site - connected to `http://localhost:3000`
