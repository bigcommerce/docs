# Catalyst version 1.3 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of Catalyst v1.3, which brings important updates including security improvements, translation updates, code cleanup, cookie consent manager, and gift certificate integration.

## Consent Manager

We have added a cookie consent manager to Catalyst that uses [c15t.com](https://c15t.com) under the hood.  Once you enable cookie tracking in your storefront channel settings, you will see a consent manager that allows
shoppers to choose which cookies they want to allow to track their behavior on your storefront.c

## Gift Certificates

We have added a gift certificate integration to Catalyst. This allows you to create and manage gift certificates on your storefront. You can create gift certificates, apply them to orders, and manage them in the control panel.

## Security and Code Cleanup

### ReCAPTCHA Code Removal

We have removed the reCAPTCHA code from Catalyst until we're ready to add it at a later point if needed. This cleanup removes old commented-out blocks and simplifies the codebase. If you were using any reCAPTCHA functionality, you'll need to remove any reCAPTCHA mentions from your GraphQL mutations and queries.

## Translation Updates

Multiple translation updates have been included in this release to improve the internationalization support across different languages and regions. These updates ensure better localization for global storefronts.

## Migration Notes

- Remove any reCAPTCHA mentions from GraphQL mutations and queries
