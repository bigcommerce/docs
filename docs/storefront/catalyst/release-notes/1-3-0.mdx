# Catalyst version 1.3 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of Catalyst v1.3, which brings new features including a cookie consent manager and gift certificate functionality, along with translation updates and reCAPTCHA code removal.

## Consent Manager

We have added a [cookie consent manager](/docs/storefront/catalyst/reference/security#consent-manager) to Catalyst that utilizes the [c15t.com](https://c15t.com) consent management library under the hood to manage shopper privacy preferences when it comes to cookies and data collection. This provides a comprehensive solution for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other privacy regulation compliance.

Once you enable cookie tracking in your storefront settings, shoppers will see a consent banner that allows them to manage their privacy preferences for different types of cookies and data collection activities.

## Gift Certificates

We have implemented Gift Certificate functionality in Catalyst to mirror what is already available in Stencil. This includes:

- Enabling shoppers to purchase gift certificates (respecting merchant-defined configurations such as fixed vs. variable amounts, expiration durations, and available templates)
- Previewing certificates before purchase
- Redeeming them in the cart and checkout (API already exists)
- Checking balances directly from the storefront

To support these experiences, we also are introducing foundational [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/graphql-storefront) operations for gift certificates, laying the groundwork for future extensibility.

## ReCAPTCHA Code Removal

<Callout type='warning'>
	If you were using any reCAPTCHA functionality, you'll need to remove any
	reCAPTCHA mentions from your GraphQL mutations and queries.
</Callout>

We have removed the reCAPTCHA code from Catalyst until we're ready to add it at a later point if needed. This cleanup removes old commented-out blocks and simplifies the codebase.

## Translation Updates

Multiple translation updates have been included in this release to improve the internationalization support across different languages and regions. These updates ensure better localization for global storefronts.

## Migration Notes

- Remove any reCAPTCHA mentions from GraphQL mutations and queries
