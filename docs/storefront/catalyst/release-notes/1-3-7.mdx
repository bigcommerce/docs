# Catalyst version 1.3.7 Release Notes

A high-severity Denial of Service ([CVE-2025-55184](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55184)) and a medium-severity Source Code Exposure ([CVE-2025-55183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55183)) related to React Server Components have been disclosed affecting React versions 19.0. This includes Next.js which is used for internal applications at Commerce as well as customers building storefronts using Catalyst and Makeswift. To avoid exposure, Next.js and React need to be updated to their latest patched versions.

The initial fix was incomplete and did not fully prevent denial-of-service attacks for all payload types, resulting in [CVE-2025-67779](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67779).

<Callout type='warning'>
	**Important**: This release provides an additional security patch for the same
	CVEs addressed in [1.3.6](/docs/storefront/catalyst/release-notes/1-3-6). You
	should upgrade to `1.3.7` to receive the latest security fixes.
</Callout>

Catalyst v1.3.7 release addresses these security vulnerabilities, including the additional CVE-2025-67779.
