# Promotion Banners with the GraphQL Storefront API

BigCommerce's GraphQL Storefront API allows you to query promotional banners that can be displayed throughout the shopper journey. This includes banners for the homepage, product pages, cart, and checkout.

<Callout type="warning">
Banner content is returned as raw HTML. You must treat this content as potentially unsafe. Always sanitize or escape the HTML before rendering it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

## Example Usage

Use the `promotionBanners` query to fetch all available promotion banners for a shopper session. Pass your current cart ID if you want to fetch context-relevant banners for the cart or checkout pages.

<Tabs items={['Request', 'Response']}>
<Tab>

```graphql filename="Example query: Get all promotion banners" showLineNumbers copy
query GetPromotionBanners($cartId: String) {
  site {
    promotion {
      banners(cartEntityId: $cartId) {
        content
        locations
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```json filename="Example response: Get all promotion banners" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "data": {
    "site": {
      "promotion": {
        "banners": [
          {
            "content": "product promotion banner",
            "locations": ["PRODUCT_PAGE"]
          },
          {
            "content": "homepage promotion banner",
            "locations": ["HOME_PAGE"]
          },
          {
            "content": "promotion banner on home and product page",
            "locations": ["HOME_PAGE", "PRODUCT_PAGE"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Points

- **Sanitize HTML**: Banners are delivered as raw HTML strings. Always sanitize these strings before rendering in your storefront to protect against XSS attacks.
- **Dynamic Content**: The returned banners may change depending on the shopperâ€™s session, cart contents, or other dynamic factors.
- **`cartId` Parameter**: Pass the current cart ID for cart/checkout-specific banners.
