# Best Practices for Using GraphQL APIs to Ensure Platform Stability & Reliability

GraphQL APIs provide merchants with powerful data retrieval capabilities, but without proper management, they can strain platform stability and performance. To maintain a seamless experience for all users, merchants should adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Implement Caching for Better Performance** 
   * Reduce API response times by caching frequently requested data.
   * Minimize redundant processing to improve scalability and handle more users efficiently.
   * Ensure cache invalidation mechanisms update data appropriately to prevent stale responses.
2. **Use a Trusted Proxy for Stability & Security**
   * Optimize API interactions by improving security, controlling costs, and enhancing performance.
   * Reduce unnecessary API load through traffic filtering and intelligent caching.
   * Ensure reliable and secure data exchange, essential for smooth eCommerce operations.
3. **Optimize Query Complexity & Structure**
   * Limit query depth to avoid expensive, resource-intensive requests.
   * Monitor and throttle excessive concurrent queries to prevent system overload.
   * Implement inflight limits to control the number of active GraphQL queries per merchant.
4. **Monitor & Analyze API Usage**
   * Track usage patterns to detect anomalies and prevent potential abuse.
   * Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as traffic spikes and unusual query patterns.  
5. **Secure API Access & Prevent Misuse**
   * Disable introspection queries in production to prevent exposure of API schema details.
   * Restrict query batching to prevent resource-intensive bulk operations.
