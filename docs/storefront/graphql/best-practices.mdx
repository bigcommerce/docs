# Best Practices for Using GraphQL APIs to Ensure Store Stability & Reliability

GraphQL APIs provide merchants with powerful data retrieval capabilities, but without proper management, they can strain store stability and performance. To maintain a seamless experience for all users, merchants should adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Implement Caching for Better Performance** 
   * Share cached data when multiple users request the same information.
   * Minimize redundant API calls - only request the data you need to improve scalability.
   * Use cache invalidation to update data appropriately and prevent stale responses.
2. **Use a [Trusted Proxy](/docs/storefront/headless#overview) for Stability & Security**
   * Ensure the true client IP is propagated to GraphQL when using a proxy.
   * Improve security and optimize performance through proper proxy use.
   * Filter traffic and leverage intelligent caching to reduce API load.
   * Maintain secure and reliable data exchange for smooth eCommerce operations.
3. **Optimize Query Complexity & Structure**
   * Limit query depth to prevent resource-intensive requests.
   * Monitor and throttle excessive concurrent queries to prevent system overload.
   * Implement inflight limits to control the number of active GraphQL queries per customer.
4. **Monitor & Analyze API Usage**
   * Track API usage to detect anomalies and prevent abuse.
   * Set up alerts for unusual query patterns or sudden traffic spikes.  
5. **Secure API Access & Prevent Misuse**
   * Protect your API from unauthorized access and abuse. One key measure is turning off introspection queries in a production environment.
   * Restrict query batching to prevent resource-intensive bulk operations.
