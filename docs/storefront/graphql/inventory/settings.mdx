# Get Inventory

You can query inventory information using the GraphQL Storefront API. The information accessible by any storefront API is controlled by the [inventory settings](#inventory-settings) for the store.

For example queries, see [Query Inventory with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/inventory/queries).

To work with inventory settings, the [API account](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts) that generates [Storefront tokens](/docs/rest-authentication/tokens) must include one of the following [OAuth scopes](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#oauth-scopes):

| UI Name | Permission | Parameter |
|:--------|:-----------|:----------|
| Products | modify | `store_v2_products` |
| Products | read-only | `store_v2_products_read_only` |

Use these scopes to read and change the following information:

- The total inventory quantity of a particular product or variant that is available for shoppers across all visible locations
- The inventory quantity of a particular variant that is available at a specified location

## Settings to retrieve inventories

### Inventory Settings

Regardless of physical stock levels, inventory quantities may return `null` depending on the store's inventory settings, accessible through the [Settings API](/docs/rest-management/settings/inventory) or the **Settings** > **Inventory** page in the store control panel.

In the following cases, inventory-related storefront queries may return different responses than expected:

| Case | Response |
|:-----|:---------|
| Out-of-stock products are hidden from the storefront | No responses will contain that product |
| Stock levels are hidden from the storefront | Inventory levels will always return `null` |
| Only products low in stock display inventory levels | Inventory levels for products with quantities above the low-stock threshold will always return `null` |

A store's inventory settings also affect inventory levels for variants. To see examples of these responses, see [Query Inventory with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/inventory/queries).

### Location settings 

- When a location is _enabled_, its inventory of products and variants is accessible to the storefront. This inventory is included in the aggregate stock for a product or variant.
- If a location is _enabled_ and _visible_, its inventory is fetched when you query the stock for a variant at each location.  

To enable locations and change location visibility, use the [Update locations](/docs/rest-management/locations#update-locations) endpoint.
