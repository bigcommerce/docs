# Get Locations

You can query location information using the GraphQL Storefront API. The information accessible by any storefront API is controlled by the [location settings](#location-settings) for the store.

For example queries, see [Query Locations with the GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql/locations/queries).

To work with locations, the [API account](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts) that generates [Storefront tokens](/docs/rest-authentication/tokens) must include one of the following [OAuth scopes](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#oauth-scopes):

| UI Name | Permission | Parameter |
|:--------|:-----------|:----------|
| Information & Settings | modify | `store_v2_information` |
| Information & Settings | read-only | `store_v2_information_read_only` |

Use these scopes to read and change the following information:

- The storefront details for a location 
- General store information
- Location addresses
- Contact details 

<Callout type="info">
  The _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ pattern is designed to center a single online storefront. _Buy Online, Pick up in Store_ is not compatible with multi-storefront channels (MSF).
</Callout>

## Location settings

A location must be _enabled_ and _visible_ in order for the GraphQL Storefront API to storefront details for the location.

If a location is not enabled or visible, send a request to the [Update Locations](/docs/rest-management/locations#update-locations) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Update location" showLineNumbers copy
PUT https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/inventory/locations
X-Auth-Token: {{access_token}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "enabled": true,
    "storefront_visibility": true
  }
]  
```
