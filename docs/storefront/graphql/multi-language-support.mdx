# Multi-Language Support

The Storefront GraphQL API supports queries for multiple languages translations within a channel.

The API uses the browser's cookies to determine a shopper's language preference. 
To override the shopper's preference, you can specify a preferred locale through the `Accept-Language` header or a GraphQL directive when you send the query.

The response includes the following:
- Product data for a locale that you can set using the GraphQL Admin API. For more information on the product data you can set, see [International Enhancements for Multi-Storefront]().
- The resolved locale to indicate the locale that contains the returned data.
- A list of the [enabled locales]() for a channel.

```gql filename="Get products from a locale" showLineNumbers copy
query @shopperPreferences(locale:"fr") { # specific requested locale via directive; takes precedence over Accept-Language header
  shopperPreferences {
    locale {
      resolved # resolved locale
    }
  }
  site {
    settings {
      locales { # list of enabled locales
        code
        isDefault
      }
    }
    products {
      edges {
        node {
          name # should return localized name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
