# Routes with the GraphQL Storefront API

BigCommerce's GraphQL Storefront API lets you retrieve routes from each storefront channel. By accessing routes and product URLs, you can easily build headless storefront applications using BigCommerce's built-in content.

The `LookUpUrl` capability supports redirects, helping you determine which pages to display. The `Redirect` node within the `route` node will return redirect details if they exist for a given path. If no redirect is configured, it will return `null`.

The `route` node includes a redirect argument with a default value of `IGNORE`. This makes the `route` node backward-compatible with previous API versions.

## Redirect enum values

The redirect argument supports the following values:

* **IGNORE**: The Storefront GraphQL API ignores redirects and uses custom URLs. If both a redirect and an entity URL are configured for the same path, both the `redirect` and `node` nodes will return non-null values for their respective URLs.

* **FOLLOW**: 

    * For dynamic or association redirects, the `node` node will return the entity (e.g., category, product) to which the redirect points.
    * For static/manual redirects, the `node` node will return null (since thereâ€™s no associated entity), but the `redirect` node will still return the redirect details.

## Example query

Here is an example query for retrieving a product with the redirect type:

```graphql filename="Get a product with the redirect type" showLineNumbers copy

 query LookUpUrl(
   $urlPath: String!
   # Use GraphQL Query Variables to provide a path
 ) {
   site {
     route(path: $urlPath) {
       node {
         __typename
         id
         # A different response is returned based on which type of object was matched
         ... on Category {
           name
           description
         }
         ... on Brand {
           name
           defaultImage {
             url(width: 200)
           }
         }
         ... on Product {
           name
           description
           images {
             edges {
               node {
                 url(width: 500, height: 500)
               }
             }
           }
         }
         ... on Redirect {
           # all redirect attributes
           toUrl
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
```
