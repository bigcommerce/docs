Global settings apply when inventory changes through a [manual order](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Creating-a-Manual-Order?language=en_US). The settings for a channel apply when inventory changes through an order in a channel.

      Fires when _variant_ inventory levels change in response to the order-related events configured in [Inventory settings](/docs/rest-management/settings/inventory#get-inventory-settings). For example, stock levels can change when you either place or complete/ship an order. Stock levels can also change when an order status changes to cancelled or refunded, but not partially refunded. Global settings apply when inventory changes through a [manual order](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Creating-a-Manual-Order?language=en_US). The settings for a channel apply when inventory changes through an order in a channel.
      
      The webhook does not fire for products without variants. For products with variants, the webhook only fires when the product's inventory properties are configured to track by _variant_.
