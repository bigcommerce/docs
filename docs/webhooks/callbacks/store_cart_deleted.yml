      Fires when a cart is deleted. This ends the lifecycle of the cart. Events include the following:
      
      * When a storefront shopper or API call removes all items from the cart
      * When the cart is explicitly removed by API using a DELETE request      
      
      The store/cart/updated webhook fires simultaneously with store/cart/deleted.
