      Fires when you edit attributes for a local or shared variant option. Updates to the global store and channel locale as an override triggers the webhook. The `context` fields are present for only updates to overrides, not the global store. For information on updating overrides, see the [International Enhancements for Multi-Storefront](/docs/store-operations/catalog/msf-international-enhancements) overview.
    
      For shared options, the maximum number of product IDs in a payload is 100. If a shared modifier is assigned to more than 100 products, the payload includes a link to the API so you can query all the event data.
