      Fires when _base product_ inventory levels change in response to the order-related events configured in [Inventory settings](/docs/rest-management/settings/inventory#get-inventory-settings). You can adjust stock levels when you place or complete/ship an order. You can also select to have stock levels adjusted when you directly change an order's status to cancelled or refunded through [Orders > View](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Order-Statuses?language=en_US#changing-status) in the control panel or via API. Note that this does not apply when [processing a refund](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Processing-Refunds?language=en_US#limitations) or the partially refunded status. 
      
      Global settings apply when inventory changes through a [manual order](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Creating-a-Manual-Order?language=en_US). The settings for a channel apply when inventory changes through an order in a channel.
      
      The webhook always fires for products without variants. For products with variants, the webhook only fires when the product's inventory properties are configured to track by _product_.
