# How to lint a document with the DX linter script

The Developer Documentation team uses a custom script to lint doc files before they are pushed. This linter covers everything our in-house Style Guide does, saving you time. 

Run the script using the CLI to get your PR submission nearly perfect in no time.

> ⚠️ Before running the script, ensure your nvm version is at least 18. You can update the nvm version using the following command: 
>
> `nvm use 18`

1. Open terminal and navigate to the file's folder.

2. Run `npx github:bigcommerce/dev-docs-style-guide-linter ./{{yourfilename}}.mdx.`

Example: `npx github:bigcommerce/dev-docs-style-guide-linter ./start/authentication/index.mdx`

> ℹ️ **NOTE:** Ensure your file name has the correct path.

3. Review the flagged items and make necessary updates.

4. Repeat Step 2 to re-run the linter.
