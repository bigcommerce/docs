# How to lint a document with the DX linter script

The Developer Documentation team uses a custom script to lint your doc files before they are pushed. This linter covers everything our in-house Style Guide does, saving you tons of time. 

Run the script using the CLI to get your PR submission nearly perfect in no time.
