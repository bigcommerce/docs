    description: This webhook will fire whenever a cart is deleted. This will occur either when all items have been removed from a cart and it is auto-deleted, or when the cart is explicitly removed via a DELETE request by an API consumer. This ends the lifecycle of the cart. The store/cart/updated webhook will also fire when the last item is removed.
