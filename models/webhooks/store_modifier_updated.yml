      Fires when product modifier overrides are edited. 
      
      For shared modifiers, the maximum number of product IDs in a payload is 100. If a shared modifier is assigned to more than 100 products, the payload includes a link to the API so you can query all the event data.  

      Attributes for a modifier are updated globally or for a channel locale. If the update was made for the global store, the context is not provided.
