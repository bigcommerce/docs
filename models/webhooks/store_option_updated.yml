      Fires when you edit attributes for a product option globally or for a channel locale (i.e. overrides). `attributes` and `context` fields are present for only override updates. 
    
      For shared options, the maximum number of product IDs in a payload is 100. If a shared modifier is assigned to more than 100 products, the payload includes a link to the API so you can query all the event data.
