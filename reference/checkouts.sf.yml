    Manage checkout operations and data on BigCommerce-hosted storefronts. To work with headless storefronts, use the [GraphQL Storefront API](/graphql-storefront/reference).
    
    The REST Storefront API uses [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers for authentication, and therefore has no required scopes. You do not need to send any BigCommerce-specific tokens with your requests to these endpoints.
        
    For info about authenticating BigCommerce APIs, see [Authentication and Example Requests](/docs/start/authentication#same-origin-cors-authentication).

      description: |
        Adds a new *Consignment* to *Checkout*.

        Perform the following two steps to define the fulfillment of the items in the cart.
        
        ### For shipping consignments:
        
          1. Add a new Consignment to Checkout.
          
              * Send a `POST` request to `/consignments` with each shipping address, line item IDs, and quantities. Each address can have its own line item IDs.
              * Provide a full valid customer address before placing the order. If provided, the order placement will succeed. 
              * As part of the request URL make sure to add `include=consignments.availableShippingOptions` to return the available shipping options based on the items, the address, and the shipping location. This will return `availableShippingOptions` in the response.

              * Required Fields:
                * `shipping_address` (deprecated) or `address`
                * `lineItems`
              
          2. Update the Consignment with Shipping Options using the [REST Storefront API](/docs/rest-storefront/checkouts/checkout-consignments#update-a-consignment), the [REST Management API](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-consignments#update-checkout-consignment) or the [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/guide/graphql-storefront).
                
        ### For pickup consignments:
        
          Create a new consignment object. 
          
              - Send a `POST` request to `/consignments` with line item IDs and quantities.
              - Provide a `pickupMethodId`. This is the `id` of the Pickup Method provided in the response body of the Storefront Pickup Options API.
              - Required Fields:
                  * `pickupOption`
                  * `lineItems`

        - Checkout Consignments
      summary: Update a Consignment
      description: |-
        Updates an existing consignment. An update is either one of the following:

        1. Updates the consignment address and/or line items.
        2. Selects a specific fulfillment option.

        ### Update the consignment address and line items
        For this type of update, the payload is the same as when creating a new consignment.         Update each *Consignment* `shippingOptionId` (shipping address and line items) with the `availableShippingOption > id` from the POST `/consignment` response. 
        
        **Note:**
        Updating a consignment could invalidate the value for `selectedShippingOption` and `selectedPickupOption`.
        
        ### Select a specific fulfillment option
        Before placing an order, each consignment must have a `selectedShippingOption` or a `selectedPickupOption`.
        
        If the consignment already has a pick-up option selected and a shipping option is provided, the pick-up option will be deselected and the shipping option will be selected instead (and vice versa). The `PUT` request will fail if it contains a shipping option ID and a pickup option ID.
        
        Required Fields:
        * `shippingOptionId` or `pickupOptionId`
        * `lineItems`

        > #### Notes
        > * You cannot pass both an `address` and a `shippingOptionId` because the shipping option may not be available for the new address
