    Get product pricing on BigCommerce-hosted storefronts. To work with headless storefronts, use the [GraphQL Storefront API](/graphql-storefront/reference).
    
    The REST Storefront API uses [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers for authentication, and therefore has no required scopes. You do not need to send any BigCommerce-specific tokens with your requests to these endpoints.
