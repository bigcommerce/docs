    Manage newsletter and marketing email subscriptions on BigCommerce-hosted storefronts. To work with headless storefronts, use the [GraphQL Storefront API](/graphql-storefront/reference).
    
    The REST Storefront API uses [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers for authentication, and therefore has no required scopes. You do not need to send any BigCommerce-specific tokens with your requests to these endpoints.
    
    For info about authenticating BigCommerce APIs, see [Authentication and Example Requests](/docs/start/authentication#same-origin-cors-authentication).

        Creates or updates an email subscription.

        By default, customers receive abandoned cart emails as soon as they provide their email address in the checkout flow. They can opt out using this endpoint.

        However, if **Store Settings > Miscellaneous > Require Consent** is enabled, Abandoned Cart Emails are not sent by default, and the customer should opt-in.

        > #### Note
        > * Substitute your storefront domain for `yourstore.example.com`. 
        > * The Send a Test Request feature is not currently supported for this endpoint.
